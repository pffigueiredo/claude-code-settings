This method is more convenient as it eliminates the need to manage API keys in Cursor. Additionally, you will automatically receive the latest features and improvements as soon as they are released.\n    37→\n    38→2. **Local MCP Server:** Run the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, authenticating with a Neon API key.\n    39→\n    40→### Prerequisites\n    41→\n    42→Before you begin, ensure you have the following:\n    43→\n    44→1. **Cursor Editor:** Download and install Cursor from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com).\n    45→2. **A Neon Account and Project:** You'll need a Neon account and a project. You can quickly create a new Neon project here [pg.new](https://pg.new)\n    46→3. **Neon API Key (for Local MCP server):** After signing up, get your Neon API Key from the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys). This API key is needed to authenticate your application with Neon. For instructions, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).\n    47→\n    48→   <Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon API Key Security\">\n    49→   Keep your Neon API key secure, and never share it publicly. It provides access to your Neon projects.\n    50→   </Admonition>\n    51→\n    52→4. **Node.js (>= v18) and npm:** Ensure Node.js (version 18 or later) and npm are installed.

Open Cursor.\n    71→2. Create a `.cursor` directory in your project's root directory. This is where Cursor will look for the MCP server configuration.\n    72→3. Paste the following JSON configuration into a file named `mcp.json` in the\n    73→   `.cursor` directory:\n    74→\n    75→   ```json\n    76→   {\n    77→     \"mcpServers\": {\n    78→       \"Neon\": {\n    79→         \"command\": \"npx\",\n    80→         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n    81→       }\n    82→     }\n    83→   }\n    84→   ```\n    85→\n    86→   If you have other MCP servers configured, you can copy just the `Neon` part.\n    87→\n    88→   Save the `mcp.json` file after pasting the configuration.\n    89→\n    90→4. **Restart Cursor** or reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette). If Cursor prompts you to Enable the MCP server, click **Enable**.\n    91→\n    92→5. An OAuth window will open in your browser. Follow the prompts to authorize Cursor to access your Neon account.\n    93→   ![Neon OAuth window](/docs/guides/neon-oauth-window.png)\n    94→\n    95→6.

This is possible by combining [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use [Cursor's Composer](https://docs.cursor.com/composer) and Neon's MCP server to perform database migrations in your Neon project.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Key components\n\nLet's break down the key components in this setup:\n\n- **Cursor**: Cursor is an AI-first code editor that supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) for interfacing with external tools (APIs, databases, etc.)\n\n- **Neon MCP Server**: Neon's MCP server acts as a bridge between MCP clients like Cursor and [Neon's API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), letting you work with Neon databases using natural language commands.\n\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: MCP is a lightweight communication standard that allows Cursor and Neon MCP Server to work together.\n\n## Setting up Neon MCP Server in Cursor\n\nYou have two options for connecting Cursor to the Neon MCP Server:\n\n1. **Remote MCP Server (Preview):** Connect to Neon's managed MCP server using OAuth for authentication. This method is more convenient as it eliminates the need to manage API keys in Cursor. Additionally, you will automatically receive the latest features and improvements as soon as they are released.\n\n2. **Local MCP Server:** Run the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, authenticating with a Neon API key.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n1. **Cursor Editor:** Download and install Cursor from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com).\n2. **A Neon Account and Project:** You'll need a Neon account and a project. You can quickly create a new Neon project here [pg.new](https://pg.new)\n3. **Neon API Key (for Local MCP server):** After signing up, get your Neon API Key from the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys). This API key is needed to authenticate your application with Neon. For instructions, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).\n\n   <Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon API Key Security\">\n   Keep your Neon API key secure, and never share it publicly. It provides access to your Neon projects.\n   </Admonition>\n\n4. **Node.js (>= v18) and npm:** Ensure Node.js (version 18 or later) and npm are installed. Download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).\n\n### Option 1: Setting up the Remote Hosted Neon MCP Server\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nBy default, the Remote MCP Server connects to your personal Neon account. To connect to an organization's account, you must authenticate with an API key. For more information, see [API key-based authentication](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#api-key-based-authentication).\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Quick Install (Recommended)\n\nClick the button below to install the Neon MCP server in Cursor. When prompted, click **Install** within Cursor.\n\n<a href=\"cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Neon&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5uZW9uLnRlY2gvbWNwIn0%3D\"><img src=\"https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg\" alt=\"Add Neon MCP server to Cursor\" height=\"32\" /></a>\n\n#### Manual Setup\n\nThis method uses Neon's managed server and OAuth authentication.\n\n1. Open Cursor.\n2. Create a `.cursor` directory in your project's root directory. This is where Cursor will look for the MCP server configuration.\n3. Paste the following JSON configuration into a file named `mcp.json` in the\n   `.cursor` directory:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   If you have other MCP servers configured, you can copy just the `Neon` part.\n\n   Save the `mcp.json` file after pasting the configuration.\n\n4. **Restart Cursor** or reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette). If Cursor prompts you to Enable the MCP server, click **Enable**.\n\n5. An OAuth window will open in your browser. Follow the prompts to authorize Cursor to access your Neon account.\n   ![Neon OAuth window](/docs/guides/neon-oauth-window.png)\n\n6. You can verify that the connection is successful by checking the **MCP Servers** section in Cursor settings.\n   ![Cursor with Neon MCP Tools](/docs/guides/cursor-with-neon-mcp-tools.png)\n\n7. Cursor is now connected to Neon's remote MCP server.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is in preview due to the [new OAuth MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/), expect potential changes as we continue to refine the OAuth integration.\n</Admonition>\n\n### Option 2: Setting up the Local Neon MCP Server\n\nThis method runs the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, using a Neon API key for authentication.\n\n1. Open Cursor.\n2. Create a `.cursor` directory in your project's root directory. This is where Cursor will look for the MCP server configuration.\n3. Paste the following JSON configuration into a file named `mcp.json` in the `.cursor` directory. Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key which you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section:\n\n   <CodeTabs labels={[\"MacOS/Linux\", \"Windows\", \"Windows (WSL)\"]}>\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"cmd\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/c\",\n           \"npx\",\n           \"-y\",\n           \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\",\n           \"start\",\n           \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"wsl\",\n         \"args\": [\"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   </CodeTabs>\n\n   If you have other MCP servers configured, you can copy just the `Neon` part.\n\n   ![Cursor Local MCP JSON](/docs/guides/cursor-local-mcp-server-json.png)\n\n4. Save the `mcp.json` file after pasting the configuration.\n\n5. **Restart Cursor** or reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette).\n\n6. Cursor is now connected to Neon's MCP server. You can verify that the connection is successful by checking the **MCP Servers** section in Cursor settings.\n\n   ![Cursor with Neon MCP Tools](/docs/guides/cursor-with-neon-mcp-tools.png)\n\nYou've now configured Neon MCP Server in Cursor and can manage your Neon Postgres databases using AI.\n\n### Verification\n\nNow that you have the Neon MCP server set up either remotely or locally, you can verify the connection and test the available tools.\n\n1. Open a Cursor **Chat** using the keyboard shortcut **Command + I** (on Mac) or **Control + I** (on Windows) and select the **Agent** option from the drop-down menu.\n\n   ![Cursor Composer view](/docs/guides/cursor_chat_view.png)\n\n2.

Remember that LLMs can sometimes produce unexpected results, so careful monitoring is always recommended.\n</Admonition>\n\nHere's the conversation log between the user and Cursor:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: In my neon project id: round-salad-44063611 list all the tables\nCursor: I'll help you list all the tables in your Neon project. I'll use the default database name 'neondb' since none was specified.\n> Called MCP Tool (get_database_tables)\n> I found one table in your database:\n> playing_with_neon (in the public schema)\n> Would you like to see more details about this table's structure or perform any other operations with it?\n\nUser: Can you show me first 5 rows?\nCursor: I'll query the first 5 rows from the playing_with_neon table.\n> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)\n> Here are the first 5 rows from the table. The table has three columns:\n> id (sequential numbers)\n> name (string values)\n> value (decimal numbers)\n> Would you like to perform any other operations with this data?\n\nUser: can you add a created_at column?\nCursor: I'll help you add a created_at column to the playing_with_neon table. I'll set it up with a timestamp data type and set it to automatically record the creation time of new rows.\n> Called MCP Tool (prepare_database_migration)\n> Let me verify the change in the temporary branch to make sure it was applied correctly.\n> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)\n> I've added the created_at column to the playing_with_neon table in a temporary branch. Would you like to commit this migration to the production branch?\n> Migration Details:\n> Migration ID: a65babcd-d1cc-401f-89b5-762570570102\n> Temporary Branch Name: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i\n> Temporary Branch ID: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i\n> Migration Result: Success\n> Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with applying this change to the production branch.\n\nUser: yeah do it\nCursor: I'll complete the migration and apply the changes to the production branch.\n> Called MCP Tool (complete_database_migration)\n> The migration has been successfully completed! The created_at column has been added to your table in the production branch, and the temporary branch has been cleaned up.\n```\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** You can use simple, conversational English to interact with your database.\n- **Step-by-step guidance:** Cursor (Claude) confirms each step and provides details like branch names and migration IDs.\n- **MCP Tools in Action:** The underlying MCP tools (`get_database_tables`, `run_sql`, `prepare_database_migration`, `complete_database_migration`) illustrate the automated process.\n- **Branching for safety:** The agent automatically creates a temporary branch for schema changes. The user will be prompted to confirm the migration before applying it to the production branch.\n\nYou can verify the changes in your Neon Console or by querying the database directly.\n\n![Neon Console with added column](/docs/guides/neon-cursor-mcp-added-column.png)\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nWhile the Neon MCP server allows you to utilize all of Neon's functionalities, you can also use a [generic Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) to connect to Neon.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Bonus: Creating a project and branch\n\nBeyond schema changes, you can also manage your Neon projects and branches directly within Cursor using natural language commands. This can be useful for quickly setting up a new development or test environment.\n\n### Creating a new project\n\nLet's say you want to create a new Neon project named \"my-new-project\". You can simply tell Cursor:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a Neon project named \"my-new-project\"\nCursor: I'll help you create a new Neon project with the specified name.\n> Called MCP Tool (create_project)\n> Great! I've created a new Neon project for you with the name \"my-new-project\". Here are the important details:\n> Project ID: orange-dawn-33739962\n> Default branch: main\n> Default database: neondb\n> The project is ready to use. You can start creating tables and working with your database right away.\n```\n\n![Cursor creating a new Neon project](/docs/guides/cursor-mcp-create-new-project.png)\n\nCursor will then use the `create_project` MCP tool to initiate the project creation. It will provide you with a project ID and name.\n\n### Creating a New Branch\n\nOnce you have a project, you can easily create new branches for development or experimentation. For example, to create a branch named \"feature-x\" in your \"my-new-project\" project:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a branch named \"feature-x\"\nCursor: Perfect! I've created a new branch named \"feature-x\". Here are the details:\n> Branch ID: br-cold-mountain-a523ka2w\n> Branch name: feature-x\n> Parent branch ID: br-odd-pine-a5y53krm\n> The branch has been created successfully and is ready for use.\n```\n\n![Cursor creating a new Neon branch](/docs/guides/cursor-mcp-create-new-branch.png)\n\nCursor will use the `create_branch` MCP tool to create the branch and provide you with the branch name and ID. Notice how we don't need to specify the project ID, as Cursor remembers the active project context.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCursor combined with the Neon MCP Server, whether using the **Remote Hosted (Preview)** option or the **Local Server** setup, lets you use natural language to interact with your database and take advantage of Neon's branching capabilities for fast iteration. This approach is ideal for quickly testing\ndatabase ideas and making schema changes during development.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Adding an MCP Server to Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)\n- [Neon Docs](/docs)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n\n<NeedHelp/>\n","numLines":336,"startLine":1,"totalLines":336}}}

This is possible by combining [Codeium Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) with the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use [Windsurf's Cascade](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/cascade) and Neon's MCP server to perform database migrations in your Neon project.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Key components\n\nLet's break down the key components in this setup:\n\n- **Codeium Windsurf**: Windsurf is Codeium's next-generation AI IDE, featuring Cascade, an agentic chatbot that supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) for interfacing with external tools.\n\n- **Neon MCP Server**: Neon's MCP server acts as a bridge between MCP clients like Windsurf and [Neon's API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), letting you work with Neon databases using natural language commands.\n\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: MCP is a lightweight communication standard that allows Windsurf and Neon MCP Server to work together.\n\n## Setting up Neon MCP Server in Windsurf\n\nYou have two options for connecting Windsurf to the Neon MCP Server:\n\n1. **Remote MCP Server (Preview):** Connect to Neon's managed MCP server using OAuth for authentication. This method is more convenient as it eliminates the need to manage API keys in Windsurf. Additionally, you will automatically receive the latest features and improvements as soon as they are released.\n\n2. **Local MCP Server:** Run the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, authenticating with a Neon API key.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n1.  **Codeium Windsurf Editor:** Download and install Windsurf from [codeium.com/windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf).\n2.  **A Neon Account and Project:** You'll need a Neon account and a project. You can quickly create a new Neon project here [pg.new](https://pg.new)\n3.  **Neon API Key (for Local MCP server):** After signing up, get your Neon API Key from the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys). This API key is needed to authenticate your application with Neon. For instructions, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).\n\n    <Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon API Key Security\">\n    Keep your Neon API key secure, and never share it publicly. It provides access to your Neon projects.\n    </Admonition>\n\n4.  **Node.js (>= v18) and npm:** Ensure Node.js (version 18 or later) and npm are installed. Download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).\n\n### Option 1: Setting up the Remote Hosted Neon MCP Server\n\nThis method uses Neon's managed server and OAuth authentication.\n\nYou can either watch the video below or follow the steps to set up the Neon MCP server in Windsurf.\n\n<video controls playsInline loop width=\"800\" height=\"600\">\n  <source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://neondatabase.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/neon-hosted-mcp-server.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nBy default, the Remote MCP Server connects to your personal Neon account. To connect to an organization's account, you must authenticate with an API key. For more information, see [API key-based authentication](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#api-key-based-authentication).\n</Admonition>\n\n1. Open Windsurf.\n2. Open Cascade by using `⌘L` on MacOS or `Ctrl+L` on Windows/Linux.\n3. Click on the hammer icon (🔨), then click the **\"Configure\"** button.\n   ![Windsurf Configure MCP](/docs/guides/windsurf-configure-mcp.png)\n4. This will open up the \"Manage MCPs\" file in Windsurf.\n5. Click on \"View raw config\" to open the Windsurf's MCP configuration file.\n6. Add the \"Neon\" server entry within the `mcpServers` object:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   If you have other MCP servers configured, you can copy just the Neon part.\n\n7. **Save** the MCP configuration file.\n8. Click **\"Refresh\"** (🔄) in the MCP toolbar in Windsurf Cascade.\n9. An OAuth window will open in your browser. Follow the prompts to authorize Windsurf to access your Neon account.\n   ![Neon OAuth window](/docs/guides/neon-oauth-window.png)\n10. You can verify that the connection is successful by checking the available MCP servers in Cascade. The toolbar should indicate that you have MCP servers available, and you should see \"1 available MCP server\" (or more if you configured additional servers).\n\n    ![Windsurf MCP Toolbar with Server Available](/docs/guides/windsurf-mcp-server-available.png)\n\n11. Windsurf is now connected to the Neon MCP server.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is in preview due to the [new OAuth MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/), expect potential changes as we continue to refine the OAuth integration.\n</Admonition>\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Troubleshooting OAuth Errors\">\nIf you encounter an error message like `{\"code\":\"invalid_request\",\"error\":\"invalid redirect uri\"}` when starting Windsurf with the remote MCP server, this is typically due to cached OAuth credentials. To fix this issue:\n\n1. Remove the MCP authentication cache by running: `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth`\n2. Restart Windsurf\n3. The OAuth flow will start fresh, allowing you to properly authenticate\n\nThis error commonly occurs when there are changes to the OAuth configuration or when cached credentials become invalid.\n</Admonition>\n\n### Option 2: Setting up the Local Neon MCP Server\n\nThis method runs the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, using a Neon API\nkey for authentication.\n\n1. Open Windsurf.\n2. Open Cascade by using `⌘L` on MacOS or `Ctrl+L` on Windows/Linux.\n3. Click on the hammer icon (🔨), then click the **\"Configure\"** button.\n   ![Windsurf Configure MCP](/docs/guides/windsurf-configure-mcp.png)\n4. This will open up the \"Manage MCPs\" file in Windsurf.\n5. Click on \"View raw config\" to open the Windsurf's MCP configuration file.\n6. Add the \"Neon\" server entry within the `mcpServers` object:\n\n   <CodeTabs labels={[\"MacOS/Linux\", \"Windows\", \"Windows (WSL)\"]}>\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"cmd\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/c\",\n           \"npx\",\n           \"-y\",\n           \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\",\n           \"start\",\n           \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"Neon\": {\n         \"command\": \"wsl\",\n         \"args\": [\"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   </CodeTabs>\n\n   > Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key which you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section:\n\n   If you have other MCP servers configured, you can copy just the `Neon` part.\n\n7. **Save** the MCP configuration file.\n8. Click **\"Refresh\"** (🔄) in the MCP toolbar in Windsurf Cascade to refresh the configuration.\n9. You can verify that the connection is successful by checking the available MCP servers in Cascade. The toolbar should indicate that you have MCP servers available, and you should see \"1 available MCP server\" (or more if you configured additional servers).\n   ![Windsurf MCP Toolbar with Server Available](/docs/guides/windsurf-mcp-server-available.png)\n\n   You've now configured Neon MCP Server in Windsurf and can manage your Neon Postgres databases using AI.\n\n<MCPTools />\n\nThese actions enable any MCP client like Windsurf to interact with various functionalities of the **Neon platform via the Neon API.** Certain tools, especially database migration ones, are tailored for AI agent and LLM usage, leveraging Neon's branching for safe preview and commit.\n\n## Development Workflow: Adding a Column with Windsurf and Neon MCP\n\nLet's walk through a typical development scenario: Quickly adding a column for prototyping using natural language within Windsurf's Cascade. The following chat log demonstrates a real interaction with Windsurf and the Neon MCP server.\n\n**Scenario:** During development, you decide to track timestamps for entries in your `playing_with_neon` table. You want to quickly add a `created_at` column.\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Security Reminder\">\nBe aware that Cascade currently executes commands directly from your prompts without confirmation unlike other IDE's and apps like [Cursor](/guides/cursor-mcp-neon) and [Claude](/guides/neon-mcp-server).  Review your requests thoroughly to avoid unintended or unwanted actions.\n</Admonition>\n\nFollowing is a sample interaction with Cascade where you can see how it uses the Neon MCP server to add a new column to your database table:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: in my neon project id: fancy-bush-59303206, list all the tables\nCascade: I'll help you list all the tables in your Neon project. I'll use the default database name 'neondb' since it wasn't specified.\n> MCP Tool: neon / get_database_tables\n> I found 1 table in your Neon project:\n> - playing_with_neon (in the public schema)\n> Would you like to see more details about this table or perform any operations on it?\n\nUser: can you show me first 5 rows?\nCascade: I'll query the first 5 rows from the playing_with_neon table.\n> MCP Tool: neon / run_sql\n> Here are the first 5 rows from the table. The table has three columns:\n> id: An integer identifier\n> name: A string column containing what appears to be hash-like values\n> value: A numeric column with decimal values between 0 and 1\n> Would you like to perform any other operations on this table?\n\nUser: can you add created_at column?\nCascade: I'll help you add a created_at column to the playing_with_neon table. I'll create a migration to add this column with a timestamp data type.\n> MCP Tool: neon / prepare_database_migration\n> Let me verify the changes in the temporary branch to make sure the column was added correctly.\n> I've verified that the created_at column has been added successfully in the temporary branch. Would you like me to commit this migration to the production branch?\n> The migration has been completed successfully! The created_at column has been added to the playing_with_neon table. Let's verify the change in the production branch:\n> Perfect! The created_at column has been successfully added and populated with timestamps. For existing rows, it was set to the time when the column was added. Any new rows added to the table will automatically get their creation timestamp.\n```\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** You can use simple, conversational English to interact with your database through Windsurf's Cascade.\n- **MCP Tools in Action:** The underlying MCP tools (`get_database_tables`, `run_sql`, `prepare_database_migration`, `complete_database_migration`) illustrate the automated process.\n- **Branching for safety:** The agent automatically creates a temporary branch for schema changes and tests them before committing to the production branch.\n\nYou can verify the changes in your Neon Console or by querying the database directly.\n\n![Neon Console with added column](/docs/guides/neon-cursor-mcp-added-column.png)\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nWhile the Neon MCP server allows you to utilize all of Neon's functionalities, you can also use a [generic Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) to connect to Neon.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Bonus: Creating a project and branch\n\nBeyond schema changes, you can also manage your Neon projects and branches directly within Windsurf using natural language commands. This can be useful for quickly setting up a new development or test environment.\n\n### Creating a new project\n\nLet's say you want to create a new Neon project named \"my-new-project\". You can simply tell Cascade:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a Neon project named \"my-new-project\"\nCascade: I'll help you create a new Neon project with the specified name.\n> MCP Tool: neon / create_project\n> Tool Arguments: { \"name\": \"my-new-project\" }\n> Great! I've created a new Neon project for you with the following details:\n> Project Name: `my-new-project`\n> Project ID: `restless-butterfly-08800888`\n> Default Branch: `main`\n> Default Database: `neondb`\n> The project is now ready for use. You can start creating tables, running queries, or creating additional databases as needed. Would you like to do anything specific with your new project?\n```\n\n![Windsurf creating a new Neon project](/docs/guides/windsurf-mcp-create-new-project.png)\n\nCascade will then use the `create_project` MCP tool to initiate the project creation. It will provide you with a project ID and name.\n\n### Creating a New Branch\n\nOnce you have a project, you can easily create new branches for development or experimentation. For example, to create a branch named \"feature-x\" in your \"my-new-project\" project:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a branch named \"feature-x\"\nCascade: I'll create a new branch named \"feature-x\" in your Neon project.\n> MCP Tool: neon / create_branch\n> Tool Arguments: { \"projectId\": \"restless-butterfly-08800888\", \"branchName\": \"feature-x\" }\n> Perfect! I've created a new branch with the following details:\n> Branch Name: `feature-x`\n> Branch ID: `br-aged-sun-a5woam3c`\n> Project ID: `restless-butterfly-08800888`\n> The branch has been created successfully and is ready for use. You can now make changes to this branch without affecting the production branch. Would you like to do anything with this new branch?\n```\n\n![Windsurf creating a new Neon branch](/docs/guides/windsurf-mcp-create-new-branch.png)\n\nCascade will use the `create_branch` MCP tool to create the branch and provide you with the branch name and ID. Notice how we don't need to specify the project ID, as Cascade remembers the active project context.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWindsurf with Neon MCP Server lets you use natural language to interact with your database and take advantage of Neon's branching capabilities for fast iteration. This approach is ideal for quickly testing database ideas and making schema changes during development.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Codeium Windsurf Documentation](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/getting-started)\n- [Neon Docs](/docs)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n\n<NeedHelp/>\n","numLines":295,"startLine":1,"totalLines":295}}}

This guide provides instructions for connecting popular MCP clients to the Neon MCP Server, enabling natural language interaction with your Neon projects.\n\nThis guide covers the setup for the following MCP Clients:\n\n- [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop)\n- [Claude Code](#claude-code)\n- [Cursor](#cursor)\n- [Windsurf (Codeium)](#windsurf-codeium)\n- [Cline (VS Code extension)](#cline-vs-code-extension)\n- [Zed](#zed)\n- [VS Code (with GitHub Copilot)](#vs-code-with-github-copilot)\n\nBy connecting these tools to the Neon MCP Server, you can manage your Neon projects, databases, and schemas using natural language commands within the MCP client interface.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- An MCP Client application.\n- A [Neon account](https://console.neon.tech/signup).\n- **Node.js (>= v18.0.0) and npm:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).\n\nFor Local MCP Server setup, you also need a Neon API key. See [Neon API Keys documentation](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys).\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nEnsure you are using the latest version of your chosen MCP client as MCP integration may not be available in older versions. If you are using an older version, update your MCP client to the latest version.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Connect to Neon MCP Server\n\nYou can connect to Neon MCP Server in two ways:\n\n1.  **Remote MCP Server (Preview):** Connect to Neon's managed remote MCP server using OAuth or a Neon API key.\n2.  **Local MCP Server:** Install and run the Neon MCP server locally, using a Neon API key.\n\n## Claude Desktop\n\n<Tabs labels={[\"Remote MCP Server\", \"Local MCP Server\"]}>\n\n<TabItem>\n\n1.

To resolve this:\n\n1. Remove the MCP authentication cache directory:\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth\n   ```\n2. Restart your MCP client application\n3. The OAuth flow will start fresh, allowing you to properly authenticate\n\nThis error is most common when using the remote MCP server option and can occur after OAuth configuration changes or when cached credentials become invalid.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOnce connected, you can start interacting with your Neon Postgres databases using natural language commands within your chosen MCP client. Explore the [Supported Actions (Tools)](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#supported-actions-tools) of the Neon MCP Server to understand the available functionalities.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n- [VS Code MCP Server Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)\n\n<NeedHelp/>\n","numLines":542,"startLine":1,"totalLines":542}}}

This is possible by combining [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use Claude Code's command-line interface and Neon's MCP server to perform database migrations in your Neon project.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Key components\n\nLet's break down the key components in this setup:\n\n- **Claude Code**: Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) for interfacing with external tools (APIs, databases, etc.)\n\n- **Neon MCP Server**: Neon's MCP server acts as a bridge between MCP clients like Claude Code and [Neon's API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api), letting you work with Neon databases using natural language commands.\n\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: MCP is a lightweight communication standard that allows Claude Code and Neon MCP Server to work together.\n\n## Setting up Neon MCP Server in Claude Code\n\nYou have two options for connecting Claude Code to the Neon MCP Server:\n\n1. **Remote MCP Server (Preview):** Connect to Neon's managed MCP server using OAuth for authentication. This method is more convenient as it eliminates the need to manage API keys in Claude Code. Additionally, you will automatically receive the latest features and improvements as soon as they are released.\n\n2. **Local MCP Server:** Run the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, authenticating with a Neon API key.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n1. **Claude Code:** Ensure you have Claude Code installed. Visit [docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for installation instructions.\n2. **A Neon Account and Project:** You'll need a Neon account and a project. You can quickly create a new Neon project here [pg.new](https://pg.new)\n3. **Neon API Key (for Local MCP server):** After signing up, get your Neon API Key from the [Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys). This API key is needed to authenticate your application with Neon. For instructions, see [Manage API keys](/docs/manage/api-keys).\n\n   <Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon API Key Security\">\n   Keep your Neon API key secure, and never share it publicly. It provides access to your Neon projects.\n   </Admonition>\n\n4. **Node.js (>= v18) and npm:** Ensure Node.js (version 18 or later) and npm are installed. Download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).\n\n### Option 1: Setting up the Remote Hosted Neon MCP Server\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nBy default, the Remote MCP Server connects to your personal Neon account. To connect to an organization's account, you must authenticate with an API key. For more information, see [API key-based authentication](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#api-key-based-authentication).\n</Admonition>\n\nThis method uses Neon's managed server and OAuth authentication.\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Add the Neon MCP server to Claude Code with the following command:\n   ```sh\n   claude mcp add --transport http neon https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\n   ```\n3. Start a new session of `claude` to trigger the OAuth authentication flow:\n   ```sh\n   claude\n   ```\n4. You can also trigger authentication with `/mcp` within Claude Code.\n\nIf you prefer to authenticate using a Neon API key, provide the `Authorization` header to the `mcp add` command:\n\n```sh\nclaude mcp add --transport http neon https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp \\\n    --header \"Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"\n```\n\n> Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key which you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is in preview due to the [new OAuth MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/), expect potential changes as we continue to refine the OAuth integration.\n</Admonition>\n\n### Option 2: Setting up the Local Neon MCP Server\n\nThis method runs the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, using a Neon API key for authentication.\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Add the Neon MCP server to Claude Code with the following command, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:\n   ```sh\n   claude mcp add neon -- npx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"\n   ```\n\n   > Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key which you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.\n\n3. Start a new Claude Code session with the `claude` command and start using the Neon MCP server:\n   ```sh\n   claude\n   ```\n\nYou've now configured the Neon MCP Server in Claude Code and can manage your Neon Postgres databases using AI.\n\n### Verification\n\nNow that you have the Neon MCP server set up either remotely or locally, you can verify the connection and test the available tools.\n\n1. Start Claude Code:\n   ```sh\n   claude\n   ```\n\n2. Type `/mcp` to see the available MCP servers and tools.\n\n3. Try out a Neon MCP Server tool by typing a query like `List my Neon projects` to see your projects and verify the connection.\n\n<MCPTools />\n\nThese actions enable any MCP client like Claude Code to interact with various functionalities of the **Neon platform via the Neon API.** Certain tools, especially database migration ones, are tailored for AI agent and LLM usage, leveraging Neon's branching for safe preview and commit.\n\n## Development Workflow: Adding a Column with Claude Code and Neon MCP\n\nLet's walk through a typical development scenario: Quickly adding a column for prototyping using natural language within Claude Code. The following chat log demonstrates a real interaction with Claude Code and the Neon MCP server.\n\n**Scenario:** During development, you decide to track timestamps for entries in your `playing_with_neon` table. You want to quickly add a `created_at` column.\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Security Reminder\">\nFor your security, review the tool's purpose before permitting the operation to proceed. Remember that LLMs can sometimes produce unexpected results, so careful monitoring is always recommended.\n</Admonition>\n\nHere's the conversation log between the user and Claude Code:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: In my neon project id: round-salad-44063611 list all the tables\nClaude Code: I'll help you list all the tables in your Neon project. I'll use the default database name 'neondb' since none was specified.\n> Called MCP Tool (get_database_tables)\n> I found one table in your database:\n> playing_with_neon (in the public schema)\n> Would you like to see more details about this table's structure or perform any other operations with it?\n\nUser: Can you show me first 5 rows?\nClaude Code: I'll query the first 5 rows from the playing_with_neon table.\n> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)\n> Here are the first 5 rows from the table. The table has three columns:\n> id (sequential numbers)\n> name (string values)\n> value (decimal numbers)\n> Would you like to perform any other operations with this data?\n\nUser: can you add a created_at column?\nClaude Code: I'll help you add a created_at column to the playing_with_neon table. I'll set it up with a timestamp data type and set it to automatically record the creation time of new rows.\n> Called MCP Tool (prepare_database_migration)\n> Let me verify the change in the temporary branch to make sure it was applied correctly.\n> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)\n> I've added the created_at column to the playing_with_neon table in a temporary branch. Would you like to commit this migration to the production branch?\n> Migration Details:\n> Migration ID: a65babcd-d1cc-401f-89b5-762570570102\n> Temporary Branch Name: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i\n> Temporary Branch ID: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i\n> Migration Result: Success\n> Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with applying this change to the production branch.\n\nUser: yeah do it\nClaude Code: I'll complete the migration and apply the changes to the production branch.\n> Called MCP Tool (complete_database_migration)\n> The migration has been successfully completed! The created_at column has been added to your table in the production branch, and the temporary branch has been cleaned up.\n```\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** You can use simple, conversational English to interact with your database.\n- **Step-by-step guidance:** Claude Code confirms each step and provides details like branch names and migration IDs.\n- **MCP Tools in Action:** The underlying MCP tools (`get_database_tables`, `run_sql`, `prepare_database_migration`, `complete_database_migration`) illustrate the automated process.\n- **Branching for safety:** The agent automatically creates a temporary branch for schema changes. The user will be prompted to confirm the migration before applying it to the production branch.\n\nYou can verify the changes in your Neon Console or by querying the database directly.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nWhile the Neon MCP server allows you to utilize all of Neon's functionalities, you can also use a [generic Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) to connect to Neon.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Bonus: Creating a project and branch\n\nBeyond schema changes, you can also manage your Neon projects and branches directly within Claude Code using natural language commands. This can be useful for quickly setting up a new development or test environment.\n\n### Creating a new project\n\nLet's say you want to create a new Neon project named \"my-new-project\". You can simply tell Claude Code:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a Neon project named \"my-new-project\"\nClaude Code: I'll help you create a new Neon project with the specified name.\n> Called MCP Tool (create_project)\n> Great! I've created a new Neon project for you with the name \"my-new-project\". Here are the important details:\n> Project ID: orange-dawn-33739962\n> Default branch: main\n> Default database: neondb\n> The project is ready to use. You can start creating tables and working with your database right away.\n```\n\nClaude Code will then use the `create_project` MCP tool to initiate the project creation. It will provide you with a project ID and name.\n\n### Creating a New Branch\n\nOnce you have a project, you can easily create new branches for development or experimentation. For example, to create a branch named \"feature-x\" in your \"my-new-project\" project:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a branch named \"feature-x\"\nClaude Code: Perfect! I've created a new branch named \"feature-x\". Here are the details:\n> Branch ID: br-cold-mountain-a523ka2w\n> Branch name: feature-x\n> Parent branch ID: br-odd-pine-a5y53krm\n> The branch has been created successfully and is ready for use.\n```\n\nClaude Code will use the `create_branch` MCP tool to create the branch and provide you with the branch name and ID. Notice how we don't need to specify the project ID, as Claude Code remembers the active project context.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClaude Code combined with the Neon MCP Server, whether using the **Remote Hosted (Preview)** option or the **Local Server** setup, lets you use natural language to interact with your database and take advantage of Neon's branching capabilities for fast iteration. This approach is ideal for quickly testing database ideas and making schema changes during development.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n- [Neon Docs](/docs)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n\n<NeedHelp/>"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":501,"cache_read_input_tokens":40519,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":501,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3480,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSY1oGnvqCRFXMB9eybnx","type":"assistant","uuid":"8acdc065-5432-419c-a848-30a5b8dbb2a4","timestamp":"2025-08-27T09:57:36.903Z"}

You can also trigger authentication with `/mcp` within Claude Code.\n\nIf you prefer to authenticate using a Neon API key, provide the `Authorization` header to the `mcp add` command:\n\n```sh\nclaude mcp add --transport http neon https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp \\\n    --header \"Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"\n```\n\n> Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key which you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is in preview due to the [new OAuth MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/), expect potential changes as we continue to refine the OAuth integration.\n</Admonition>\n\n### Option 2: Setting up the Local Neon MCP Server\n\nThis method runs the Neon MCP server locally on your machine, using a Neon API key for authentication.\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Add the Neon MCP server to Claude Code with the following command, replacing `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key:\n   ```sh\n   claude mcp add neon -- npx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"\n   ```\n\n   > Replace `<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>` with your actual Neon API key which you obtained from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.\n\n3. Start a new Claude Code session with the `claude` command and start using the Neon MCP server:\n   ```sh\n   claude\n   ```\n\nYou've now configured the Neon MCP Server in Claude Code and can manage your Neon Postgres databases using AI.\n\n### Verification\n\nNow that you have the Neon MCP server set up either remotely or locally, you can verify the connection and test the available tools.\n\n1. Start Claude Code:\n   ```sh\n   claude\n   ```\n\n2. Type `/mcp` to see the available MCP servers and tools.\n\n3. Try out a Neon MCP Server tool by typing a query like `List my Neon projects` to see your projects and verify the connection.\n\n<MCPTools />\n\nThese actions enable any MCP client like Claude Code to interact with various functionalities of the **Neon platform via the Neon API.** Certain tools, especially database migration ones, are tailored for AI agent and LLM usage, leveraging Neon's branching for safe preview and commit.\n\n## Development Workflow: Adding a Column with Claude Code and Neon MCP\n\nLet's walk through a typical development scenario: Quickly adding a column for prototyping using natural language within Claude Code. The following chat log demonstrates a real interaction with Claude Code and the Neon MCP server.\n\n**Scenario:** During development, you decide to track timestamps for entries in your `playing_with_neon` table. You want to quickly add a `created_at` column.\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Security Reminder\">\nFor your security, review the tool's purpose before permitting the operation to proceed. Remember that LLMs can sometimes produce unexpected results, so careful monitoring is always recommended.\n</Admonition>\n\nHere's the conversation log between the user and Claude Code:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: In my neon project id: round-salad-44063611 list all the tables\nClaude Code: I'll help you list all the tables in your Neon project. I'll use the default database name 'neondb' since none was specified.\n> Called MCP Tool (get_database_tables)\n> I found one table in your database:\n> playing_with_neon (in the public schema)\n> Would you like to see more details about this table's structure or perform any other operations with it?\n\nUser: Can you show me first 5 rows?\nClaude Code: I'll query the first 5 rows from the playing_with_neon table.\n> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)\n> Here are the first 5 rows from the table. The table has three columns:\n> id (sequential numbers)\n> name (string values)\n> value (decimal numbers)\n> Would you like to perform any other operations with this data?\n\nUser: can you add a created_at column?\nClaude Code: I'll help you add a created_at column to the playing_with_neon table. I'll set it up with a timestamp data type and set it to automatically record the creation time of new rows.\n> Called MCP Tool (prepare_database_migration)\n> Let me verify the change in the temporary branch to make sure it was applied correctly.\n> Called MCP Tool (run_sql)\n> I've added the created_at column to the playing_with_neon table in a temporary branch. Would you like to commit this migration to the production branch?\n> Migration Details:\n> Migration ID: a65babcd-d1cc-401f-89b5-762570570102\n> Temporary Branch Name: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i\n> Temporary Branch ID: br-silent-cherry-a1eqrl6i\n> Migration Result: Success\n> Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with applying this change to the production branch.\n\nUser: yeah do it\nClaude Code: I'll complete the migration and apply the changes to the production branch.\n> Called MCP Tool (complete_database_migration)\n> The migration has been successfully completed! The created_at column has been added to your table in the production branch, and the temporary branch has been cleaned up.\n```\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** You can use simple, conversational English to interact with your database.\n- **Step-by-step guidance:** Claude Code confirms each step and provides details like branch names and migration IDs.\n- **MCP Tools in Action:** The underlying MCP tools (`get_database_tables`, `run_sql`, `prepare_database_migration`, `complete_database_migration`) illustrate the automated process.\n- **Branching for safety:** The agent automatically creates a temporary branch for schema changes. The user will be prompted to confirm the migration before applying it to the production branch.\n\nYou can verify the changes in your Neon Console or by querying the database directly.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nWhile the Neon MCP server allows you to utilize all of Neon's functionalities, you can also use a [generic Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) to connect to Neon.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Bonus: Creating a project and branch\n\nBeyond schema changes, you can also manage your Neon projects and branches directly within Claude Code using natural language commands. This can be useful for quickly setting up a new development or test environment.\n\n### Creating a new project\n\nLet's say you want to create a new Neon project named \"my-new-project\". You can simply tell Claude Code:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a Neon project named \"my-new-project\"\nClaude Code: I'll help you create a new Neon project with the specified name.\n> Called MCP Tool (create_project)\n> Great! I've created a new Neon project for you with the name \"my-new-project\". Here are the important details:\n> Project ID: orange-dawn-33739962\n> Default branch: main\n> Default database: neondb\n> The project is ready to use. You can start creating tables and working with your database right away.\n```\n\nClaude Code will then use the `create_project` MCP tool to initiate the project creation. It will provide you with a project ID and name.\n\n### Creating a New Branch\n\nOnce you have a project, you can easily create new branches for development or experimentation. For example, to create a branch named \"feature-x\" in your \"my-new-project\" project:\n\n```text shouldWrap\nUser: Create a branch named \"feature-x\"\nClaude Code: Perfect! I've created a new branch named \"feature-x\". Here are the details:\n> Branch ID: br-cold-mountain-a523ka2w\n> Branch name: feature-x\n> Parent branch ID: br-odd-pine-a5y53krm\n> The branch has been created successfully and is ready for use.\n```\n\nClaude Code will use the `create_branch` MCP tool to create the branch and provide you with the branch name and ID. Notice how we don't need to specify the project ID, as Claude Code remembers the active project context.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClaude Code combined with the Neon MCP Server, whether using the **Remote Hosted (Preview)** option or the **Local Server** setup, lets you use natural language to interact with your database and take advantage of Neon's branching capabilities for fast iteration. This approach is ideal for quickly testing database ideas and making schema changes during development.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)\n- [Neon Docs](/docs)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n\n<NeedHelp/>","structuredPatch":[]}}

Instead of using the Neon Console or API, you could just type a request like, \"Create a database named 'my-new-database'\". Or, to see your projects, you might ask, \"List all my Neon projects\". The Neon MCP Server makes this possible.\n\nIt works by acting as a bridge between natural language requests and the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Built upon the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.org), it translates your requests into the necessary Neon API calls, allowing you to manage everything from creating projects and branches to running queries and performing database migrations.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Understanding MCP and Neon MCP Server\n\nThe [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.org) standardizes communication between LLMs and external tools. It defines a client-server architecture, enabling LLMs (Hosts) to connect to specialized servers that provide context and tools for interacting with external systems. The key components of the MCP architecture are:\n\n- **Hosts**: These are AI applications, such as Claude Desktop or IDEs like Cursor, that initiate connections to MCP servers\n- **Clients**: These reside within the host application and maintain one-to-one connections with individual MCP servers\n- **Server**: These programs, such as Neon's MCP Server, provide context, tools, and prompts to clients, enabling access to external data and functionalities\n\n### Why use MCP?\n\nTraditionally, connecting AI models to different data sources required developers to create custom code for each integration. This fragmented approach increased development time, maintenance burdens, and limited interoperability between AI models and tools. MCP addresses this challenge by providing a standardized protocol that simplifies integration, accelerates development, and enhances the capabilities of AI assistants.\n\n### What is Neon MCP server?\n\n**Neon MCP Server** acts as the **Server** in the MCP architecture, specifically designed for Neon. It provides a set of **tools** that MCP Clients (like Claude Desktop, Cursor) can utilize to manage Neon resources. This includes actions for project management, branch management, executing SQL queries, and handling database migrations, all driven by natural language requests.\n\n**Key Benefits of using Neon MCP Server:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** Manage Neon databases using intuitive, conversational commands.\n- **Simplified database management:** Perform complex actions without writing SQL or directly using the Neon API.\n- **Enhanced Productivity:** Streamline workflows for database administration and development.\n- **Accessibility for non-developers:** Empower users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.\n- **Database migration support:** Leverage Neon's branching capabilities for database schema changes initiated via natural language.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests.  **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP server and Neon API keys.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Setup options\n\nYou can set up the Neon MCP Server in two ways:\n\n### Remote hosted server (preview)\n\nYou can use Neon's managed MCP server, available at `https://mcp.neon.tech`. This is the **easiest** way to start using the Neon MCP Server. It streamlines the setup process by utilizing OAuth for authentication, eliminating the need to manage Neon API keys directly in your client configuration.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is currently in its preview phase. As the [OAuth specification for MCP](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/) is still quite new, we are releasing it in this preview state. During the initial weeks, you may experience some adjustments to the setup. However, the instructions provided should be straightforward to follow at this time.\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Prerequisites:\n\n- An MCP Client application (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Cline, Zed).\n- A Neon account.\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Install in a single click for Cursor users\">\nClick the button below to install the Neon MCP server in Cursor. When prompted, click **Install** within Cursor.\n\n<a href=\"cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Neon&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5uZW9uLnRlY2gvbWNwIn0%3D\"><img src=\"https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg\" alt=\"Add Neon MCP server to Cursor\" height=\"32\" /></a>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Setup steps:\n\n1.  Go to your MCP Client's settings where you configure MCP Servers (this varies by client)\n2.  Register a new MCP Server. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under 'mcpServers' key. The configuration should look like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"Neon\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This command uses `npx` to run a [small helper (`mcp-remote`)](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) that connects to Neon's hosted server endpoint (`https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp`).\n\n    MCP supports two remote server transports: the deprecated Server-Sent Events (SSE) and the newer, recommended Streamable HTTP. If your LLM client doesn't support Streamable HTTP yet, you can switch the endpoint from `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` to `https://mcp.neon.tech/sse` to use SSE instead.\n\n3.  Save the configuration and **restart or refresh** your MCP client application.\n4.  The first time the client initializes Neon's MCP server, it should trigger an **OAuth flow**:\n    - Your browser will open a Neon page asking you to authorize the \"Neon MCP Server\" to access your Neon account.\n    - Review the requested permissions and click **Authorize**.\n    - You should see a success message, and you can close the browser tab.\n5.  Your MCP client should now be connected to the Neon Remote MCP Server and ready to use.\n\n### Local MCP Server\n\nYou can install Neon MCP server locally using `npm`.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js (>= v18.0.0):** Ensure Node.js version 18 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n- **Neon API Key:** You will need a Neon API key to authenticate the Neon MCP Server with your Neon account. You can create one from the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) under your Profile settings. Refer to the [Neon documentation on API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys) for detailed instructions.\n\nOpen your MCP client application and navigate to the settings where you can configure MCP servers. The location of these settings may vary depending on your client. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under the `mcpServers` key. Your configuration should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\n\nIf you are using Windows and encounter issues while adding the MCP server, you might need to use the Command Prompt (`cmd`) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (`wsl`) to run the necessary commands. Your configuration setup may resemble the following:\n\n<CodeTabs labels={[\"Windows\", \"Windows (WSL)\"]}>\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"cmd\",\n            \"args\": [\"/c\", \"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"wsl\",\n            \"args\": [\"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n  </CodeTabs>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your client does not use `JSON` for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\n```\n\n<MCPTools />\n\n## Usage examples\n\nAfter setting up either the remote or local server and connecting your MCP client, you can start interacting with your Neon databases using natural language.\n\n**Example interactions**\n\n- **List projects:** `\"List my Neon projects\"`\n- **Create a new project:** `\"Create a Neon project named 'my-test-project'\"`\n- **List tables in a database:** `\"What tables are in the database 'my-database' in project 'my-project'?\"`\n- **Add a column to a table:** `\"Add a column 'email' of type VARCHAR to the 'users' table in database 'main' of project 'my-project'\"`\n- **Run a query:** `\"Show me the first 10 rows from the 'users' table in database 'my-database'\"`\n\n<Video  \nsources={[{src: \"/videos/pages/doc/neon-mcp.mp4\",type: \"video/mp4\",}]}\nwidth={960}\nheight={1080}\n/>\n\nYou can also refer to our individual guides for detailed examples on using the Neon MCP Server with specific MCP clients:\n\n- [Claude Desktop](/guides/neon-mcp-server)\n- [Cursor](/guides/cursor-mcp-neon)\n- [Cline](/guides/cline-mcp-neon)\n- [Windsurf (Codium)](/guides/windsurf-mcp-neon)\n- [Zed](/guides/zed-mcp-neon)\n\n## API key-based authentication\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports API key-based authentication for remote access, in addition to OAuth. This allows for simpler authentication using your [Neon API key (personal or organization)](/docs/manage/api-keys) for programmatic access. API key configuration is shown below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Neon\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer <$NEON_API_KEY>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Currently, only [streamable HTTP](#streamable-http-support) responses are supported with API-key based authentication. Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses are not yet supported for this authentication method.\n\n## Streamable HTTP support\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports streamable HTTP as an alternative to Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses. This makes it easier to consume streamed data in environments where SSE is not ideal — such as CLI tools, backend services, or AI agents. To use streamable HTTP, make sure to use the latest remote MCP server, and specify the `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` endpoint, as shown in the following configuration example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MCP security guidance\n\nThe Neon MCP server provides access to powerful tools for interacting with your Neon database—such as `run_sql`, `create_table`, `update_row`, and `delete_table`. MCP tools are useful in development and testing, but **we do not recommend using MCP tools in production environments**.\n\n### Recommended usage\n\n- Use MCP only for **local development** or **IDE-based workflows**.\n- Never connect MCP agents to production databases.\n- Avoid exposing production data or PII data to MCP — only use anonymized data.\n- Disable MCP tools capable of accessing or modifying data when they are not being used.\n- Only grant MCP access to trusted users.\n\n### Human oversight and access control\n\n- **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. The MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests, so human oversight is essential.\n- **Restrict access** to ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server and associated API keys.\n- **Monitor usage** and regularly audit who has access to your MCP server configurations and Neon API keys.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized actions when working with Neon's MCP Server.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Neon MCP Server enables natural language interaction with Neon Postgres databases, offering a simplified way to perform database management tasks. You can perform actions such as creating new Neon projects and databases, managing branches, executing SQL queries, and making schema changes, all through conversational requests. Features like branch-based migrations contribute to safer schema modifications. By connecting your preferred MCP client to the Neon MCP Server, you can streamline database administration and development workflows, making it easier for users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n\n<NeedHelp/>\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":34,"oldLines":7,"newStart":34,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ### What is Neon MCP server?"," ","-**Neon MCP Server** acts as the **Server** in the MCP architecture, specifically designed for Neon.

Instead of using the Neon Console or API, you could just type a request like, \"Create a database named 'my-new-database'\". Or, to see your projects, you might ask, \"List all my Neon projects\". The Neon MCP Server makes this possible.\n\nIt works by acting as a bridge between natural language requests and the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Built upon the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.org), it translates your requests into the necessary Neon API calls, allowing you to manage everything from creating projects and branches to running queries and performing database migrations.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Understanding MCP and Neon MCP Server\n\nThe [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.org) standardizes communication between LLMs and external tools. It defines a client-server architecture, enabling LLMs (Hosts) to connect to specialized servers that provide context and tools for interacting with external systems. The key components of the MCP architecture are:\n\n- **Hosts**: These are AI applications, such as Claude Desktop or IDEs like Cursor, that initiate connections to MCP servers\n- **Clients**: These reside within the host application and maintain one-to-one connections with individual MCP servers\n- **Server**: These programs, such as Neon's MCP Server, provide context, tools, and prompts to clients, enabling access to external data and functionalities\n\n### Why use MCP?\n\nTraditionally, connecting AI models to different data sources required developers to create custom code for each integration. This fragmented approach increased development time, maintenance burdens, and limited interoperability between AI models and tools. MCP addresses this challenge by providing a standardized protocol that simplifies integration, accelerates development, and enhances the capabilities of AI assistants.\n\n### What is Neon MCP server?\n\n**Neon MCP Server** acts as the **Server** in the MCP architecture, specifically designed for Neon. It provides a set of **tools** that MCP Clients (like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor) can utilize to manage Neon resources. This includes actions for project management, branch management, executing SQL queries, and handling database migrations, all driven by natural language requests.\n\n**Key Benefits of using Neon MCP Server:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** Manage Neon databases using intuitive, conversational commands.\n- **Simplified database management:** Perform complex actions without writing SQL or directly using the Neon API.\n- **Enhanced Productivity:** Streamline workflows for database administration and development.\n- **Accessibility for non-developers:** Empower users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.\n- **Database migration support:** Leverage Neon's branching capabilities for database schema changes initiated via natural language.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests.  **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP server and Neon API keys.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Setup options\n\nYou can set up the Neon MCP Server in two ways:\n\n### Remote hosted server (preview)\n\nYou can use Neon's managed MCP server, available at `https://mcp.neon.tech`. This is the **easiest** way to start using the Neon MCP Server. It streamlines the setup process by utilizing OAuth for authentication, eliminating the need to manage Neon API keys directly in your client configuration.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is currently in its preview phase. As the [OAuth specification for MCP](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/) is still quite new, we are releasing it in this preview state. During the initial weeks, you may experience some adjustments to the setup. However, the instructions provided should be straightforward to follow at this time.\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Prerequisites:\n\n- An MCP Client application (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Cline, Zed).\n- A Neon account.\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Install in a single click for Cursor users\">\nClick the button below to install the Neon MCP server in Cursor. When prompted, click **Install** within Cursor.\n\n<a href=\"cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Neon&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5uZW9uLnRlY2gvbWNwIn0%3D\"><img src=\"https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg\" alt=\"Add Neon MCP server to Cursor\" height=\"32\" /></a>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Setup steps:\n\n1.  Go to your MCP Client's settings where you configure MCP Servers (this varies by client)\n2.  Register a new MCP Server. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under 'mcpServers' key. The configuration should look like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"Neon\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This command uses `npx` to run a [small helper (`mcp-remote`)](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) that connects to Neon's hosted server endpoint (`https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp`).\n\n    MCP supports two remote server transports: the deprecated Server-Sent Events (SSE) and the newer, recommended Streamable HTTP. If your LLM client doesn't support Streamable HTTP yet, you can switch the endpoint from `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` to `https://mcp.neon.tech/sse` to use SSE instead.\n\n3.  Save the configuration and **restart or refresh** your MCP client application.\n4.  The first time the client initializes Neon's MCP server, it should trigger an **OAuth flow**:\n    - Your browser will open a Neon page asking you to authorize the \"Neon MCP Server\" to access your Neon account.\n    - Review the requested permissions and click **Authorize**.\n    - You should see a success message, and you can close the browser tab.\n5.  Your MCP client should now be connected to the Neon Remote MCP Server and ready to use.\n\n### Local MCP Server\n\nYou can install Neon MCP server locally using `npm`.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js (>= v18.0.0):** Ensure Node.js version 18 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n- **Neon API Key:** You will need a Neon API key to authenticate the Neon MCP Server with your Neon account. You can create one from the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) under your Profile settings. Refer to the [Neon documentation on API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys) for detailed instructions.\n\nOpen your MCP client application and navigate to the settings where you can configure MCP servers. The location of these settings may vary depending on your client. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under the `mcpServers` key. Your configuration should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\n\nIf you are using Windows and encounter issues while adding the MCP server, you might need to use the Command Prompt (`cmd`) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (`wsl`) to run the necessary commands. Your configuration setup may resemble the following:\n\n<CodeTabs labels={[\"Windows\", \"Windows (WSL)\"]}>\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"cmd\",\n            \"args\": [\"/c\", \"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"wsl\",\n            \"args\": [\"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n  </CodeTabs>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your client does not use `JSON` for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\n```\n\n<MCPTools />\n\n## Usage examples\n\nAfter setting up either the remote or local server and connecting your MCP client, you can start interacting with your Neon databases using natural language.\n\n**Example interactions**\n\n- **List projects:** `\"List my Neon projects\"`\n- **Create a new project:** `\"Create a Neon project named 'my-test-project'\"`\n- **List tables in a database:** `\"What tables are in the database 'my-database' in project 'my-project'?\"`\n- **Add a column to a table:** `\"Add a column 'email' of type VARCHAR to the 'users' table in database 'main' of project 'my-project'\"`\n- **Run a query:** `\"Show me the first 10 rows from the 'users' table in database 'my-database'\"`\n\n<Video  \nsources={[{src: \"/videos/pages/doc/neon-mcp.mp4\",type: \"video/mp4\",}]}\nwidth={960}\nheight={1080}\n/>\n\nYou can also refer to our individual guides for detailed examples on using the Neon MCP Server with specific MCP clients:\n\n- [Claude Desktop](/guides/neon-mcp-server)\n- [Cursor](/guides/cursor-mcp-neon)\n- [Cline](/guides/cline-mcp-neon)\n- [Windsurf (Codium)](/guides/windsurf-mcp-neon)\n- [Zed](/guides/zed-mcp-neon)\n\n## API key-based authentication\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports API key-based authentication for remote access, in addition to OAuth. This allows for simpler authentication using your [Neon API key (personal or organization)](/docs/manage/api-keys) for programmatic access. API key configuration is shown below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Neon\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer <$NEON_API_KEY>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Currently, only [streamable HTTP](#streamable-http-support) responses are supported with API-key based authentication. Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses are not yet supported for this authentication method.\n\n## Streamable HTTP support\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports streamable HTTP as an alternative to Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses. This makes it easier to consume streamed data in environments where SSE is not ideal — such as CLI tools, backend services, or AI agents. To use streamable HTTP, make sure to use the latest remote MCP server, and specify the `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` endpoint, as shown in the following configuration example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MCP security guidance\n\nThe Neon MCP server provides access to powerful tools for interacting with your Neon database—such as `run_sql`, `create_table`, `update_row`, and `delete_table`. MCP tools are useful in development and testing, but **we do not recommend using MCP tools in production environments**.\n\n### Recommended usage\n\n- Use MCP only for **local development** or **IDE-based workflows**.\n- Never connect MCP agents to production databases.\n- Avoid exposing production data or PII data to MCP — only use anonymized data.\n- Disable MCP tools capable of accessing or modifying data when they are not being used.\n- Only grant MCP access to trusted users.\n\n### Human oversight and access control\n\n- **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. The MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests, so human oversight is essential.\n- **Restrict access** to ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server and associated API keys.\n- **Monitor usage** and regularly audit who has access to your MCP server configurations and Neon API keys.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized actions when working with Neon's MCP Server.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Neon MCP Server enables natural language interaction with Neon Postgres databases, offering a simplified way to perform database management tasks. You can perform actions such as creating new Neon projects and databases, managing branches, executing SQL queries, and making schema changes, all through conversational requests. Features like branch-based migrations contribute to safer schema modifications. By connecting your preferred MCP client to the Neon MCP Server, you can streamline database administration and development workflows, making it easier for users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n\n<NeedHelp/>\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":24,"oldLines":7,"newStart":24,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," The [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.org) standardizes communication between LLMs and external tools.

Instead of using the Neon Console or API, you could just type a request like, \"Create a database named 'my-new-database'\". Or, to see your projects, you might ask, \"List all my Neon projects\". The Neon MCP Server makes this possible.\n\nIt works by acting as a bridge between natural language requests and the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Built upon the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.org), it translates your requests into the necessary Neon API calls, allowing you to manage everything from creating projects and branches to running queries and performing database migrations.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Understanding MCP and Neon MCP Server\n\nThe [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.org) standardizes communication between LLMs and external tools. It defines a client-server architecture, enabling LLMs (Hosts) to connect to specialized servers that provide context and tools for interacting with external systems. The key components of the MCP architecture are:\n\n- **Hosts**: These are AI applications, such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or IDEs like Cursor, that initiate connections to MCP servers\n- **Clients**: These reside within the host application and maintain one-to-one connections with individual MCP servers\n- **Server**: These programs, such as Neon's MCP Server, provide context, tools, and prompts to clients, enabling access to external data and functionalities\n\n### Why use MCP?\n\nTraditionally, connecting AI models to different data sources required developers to create custom code for each integration. This fragmented approach increased development time, maintenance burdens, and limited interoperability between AI models and tools. MCP addresses this challenge by providing a standardized protocol that simplifies integration, accelerates development, and enhances the capabilities of AI assistants.\n\n### What is Neon MCP server?\n\n**Neon MCP Server** acts as the **Server** in the MCP architecture, specifically designed for Neon. It provides a set of **tools** that MCP Clients (like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor) can utilize to manage Neon resources. This includes actions for project management, branch management, executing SQL queries, and handling database migrations, all driven by natural language requests.\n\n**Key Benefits of using Neon MCP Server:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** Manage Neon databases using intuitive, conversational commands.\n- **Simplified database management:** Perform complex actions without writing SQL or directly using the Neon API.\n- **Enhanced Productivity:** Streamline workflows for database administration and development.\n- **Accessibility for non-developers:** Empower users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.\n- **Database migration support:** Leverage Neon's branching capabilities for database schema changes initiated via natural language.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests.  **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP server and Neon API keys.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Setup options\n\nYou can set up the Neon MCP Server in two ways:\n\n### Remote hosted server (preview)\n\nYou can use Neon's managed MCP server, available at `https://mcp.neon.tech`. This is the **easiest** way to start using the Neon MCP Server. It streamlines the setup process by utilizing OAuth for authentication, eliminating the need to manage Neon API keys directly in your client configuration.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is currently in its preview phase. As the [OAuth specification for MCP](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/) is still quite new, we are releasing it in this preview state. During the initial weeks, you may experience some adjustments to the setup. However, the instructions provided should be straightforward to follow at this time.\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Prerequisites:\n\n- An MCP Client application (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Cline, Zed).\n- A Neon account.\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Install in a single click for Cursor users\">\nClick the button below to install the Neon MCP server in Cursor. When prompted, click **Install** within Cursor.\n\n<a href=\"cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Neon&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5uZW9uLnRlY2gvbWNwIn0%3D\"><img src=\"https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg\" alt=\"Add Neon MCP server to Cursor\" height=\"32\" /></a>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Setup steps:\n\n1.  Go to your MCP Client's settings where you configure MCP Servers (this varies by client)\n2.  Register a new MCP Server. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under 'mcpServers' key. The configuration should look like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"Neon\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This command uses `npx` to run a [small helper (`mcp-remote`)](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) that connects to Neon's hosted server endpoint (`https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp`).\n\n    MCP supports two remote server transports: the deprecated Server-Sent Events (SSE) and the newer, recommended Streamable HTTP. If your LLM client doesn't support Streamable HTTP yet, you can switch the endpoint from `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` to `https://mcp.neon.tech/sse` to use SSE instead.\n\n3.  Save the configuration and **restart or refresh** your MCP client application.\n4.  The first time the client initializes Neon's MCP server, it should trigger an **OAuth flow**:\n    - Your browser will open a Neon page asking you to authorize the \"Neon MCP Server\" to access your Neon account.\n    - Review the requested permissions and click **Authorize**.\n    - You should see a success message, and you can close the browser tab.\n5.  Your MCP client should now be connected to the Neon Remote MCP Server and ready to use.\n\n### Local MCP Server\n\nYou can install Neon MCP server locally using `npm`.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js (>= v18.0.0):** Ensure Node.js version 18 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n- **Neon API Key:** You will need a Neon API key to authenticate the Neon MCP Server with your Neon account. You can create one from the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) under your Profile settings. Refer to the [Neon documentation on API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys) for detailed instructions.\n\nOpen your MCP client application and navigate to the settings where you can configure MCP servers. The location of these settings may vary depending on your client. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under the `mcpServers` key. Your configuration should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\n\nIf you are using Windows and encounter issues while adding the MCP server, you might need to use the Command Prompt (`cmd`) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (`wsl`) to run the necessary commands. Your configuration setup may resemble the following:\n\n<CodeTabs labels={[\"Windows\", \"Windows (WSL)\"]}>\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"cmd\",\n            \"args\": [\"/c\", \"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"wsl\",\n            \"args\": [\"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n  </CodeTabs>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your client does not use `JSON` for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\n```\n\n<MCPTools />\n\n## Usage examples\n\nAfter setting up either the remote or local server and connecting your MCP client, you can start interacting with your Neon databases using natural language.\n\n**Example interactions**\n\n- **List projects:** `\"List my Neon projects\"`\n- **Create a new project:** `\"Create a Neon project named 'my-test-project'\"`\n- **List tables in a database:** `\"What tables are in the database 'my-database' in project 'my-project'?\"`\n- **Add a column to a table:** `\"Add a column 'email' of type VARCHAR to the 'users' table in database 'main' of project 'my-project'\"`\n- **Run a query:** `\"Show me the first 10 rows from the 'users' table in database 'my-database'\"`\n\n<Video  \nsources={[{src: \"/videos/pages/doc/neon-mcp.mp4\",type: \"video/mp4\",}]}\nwidth={960}\nheight={1080}\n/>\n\nYou can also refer to our individual guides for detailed examples on using the Neon MCP Server with specific MCP clients:\n\n- [Claude Desktop](/guides/neon-mcp-server)\n- [Cursor](/guides/cursor-mcp-neon)\n- [Cline](/guides/cline-mcp-neon)\n- [Windsurf (Codium)](/guides/windsurf-mcp-neon)\n- [Zed](/guides/zed-mcp-neon)\n\n## API key-based authentication\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports API key-based authentication for remote access, in addition to OAuth. This allows for simpler authentication using your [Neon API key (personal or organization)](/docs/manage/api-keys) for programmatic access. API key configuration is shown below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Neon\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer <$NEON_API_KEY>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Currently, only [streamable HTTP](#streamable-http-support) responses are supported with API-key based authentication. Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses are not yet supported for this authentication method.\n\n## Streamable HTTP support\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports streamable HTTP as an alternative to Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses. This makes it easier to consume streamed data in environments where SSE is not ideal — such as CLI tools, backend services, or AI agents. To use streamable HTTP, make sure to use the latest remote MCP server, and specify the `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` endpoint, as shown in the following configuration example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MCP security guidance\n\nThe Neon MCP server provides access to powerful tools for interacting with your Neon database—such as `run_sql`, `create_table`, `update_row`, and `delete_table`. MCP tools are useful in development and testing, but **we do not recommend using MCP tools in production environments**.\n\n### Recommended usage\n\n- Use MCP only for **local development** or **IDE-based workflows**.\n- Never connect MCP agents to production databases.\n- Avoid exposing production data or PII data to MCP — only use anonymized data.\n- Disable MCP tools capable of accessing or modifying data when they are not being used.\n- Only grant MCP access to trusted users.\n\n### Human oversight and access control\n\n- **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. The MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests, so human oversight is essential.\n- **Restrict access** to ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server and associated API keys.\n- **Monitor usage** and regularly audit who has access to your MCP server configurations and Neon API keys.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized actions when working with Neon's MCP Server.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Neon MCP Server enables natural language interaction with Neon Postgres databases, offering a simplified way to perform database management tasks. You can perform actions such as creating new Neon projects and databases, managing branches, executing SQL queries, and making schema changes, all through conversational requests. Features like branch-based migrations contribute to safer schema modifications.

Instead of using the Neon Console or API, you could just type a request like, \"Create a database named 'my-new-database'\". Or, to see your projects, you might ask, \"List all my Neon projects\". The Neon MCP Server makes this possible.\n\nIt works by acting as a bridge between natural language requests and the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api). Built upon the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.org), it translates your requests into the necessary Neon API calls, allowing you to manage everything from creating projects and branches to running queries and performing database migrations.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Neon MCP Server Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests. **Always review and authorize actions requested by the LLM before execution.** Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server.\n\nThe Neon MCP Server is intended for local development and IDE integrations only. **We do not recommend using the Neon MCP Server in production environments.** It can execute powerful operations that may lead to accidental or unauthorized changes.\n\nFor more information, see [MCP security guidance →](#mcp-security-guidance).\n</Admonition>\n\n## Understanding MCP and Neon MCP Server\n\nThe [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.org) standardizes communication between LLMs and external tools. It defines a client-server architecture, enabling LLMs (Hosts) to connect to specialized servers that provide context and tools for interacting with external systems. The key components of the MCP architecture are:\n\n- **Hosts**: These are AI applications, such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or IDEs like Cursor, that initiate connections to MCP servers\n- **Clients**: These reside within the host application and maintain one-to-one connections with individual MCP servers\n- **Server**: These programs, such as Neon's MCP Server, provide context, tools, and prompts to clients, enabling access to external data and functionalities\n\n### Why use MCP?\n\nTraditionally, connecting AI models to different data sources required developers to create custom code for each integration. This fragmented approach increased development time, maintenance burdens, and limited interoperability between AI models and tools. MCP addresses this challenge by providing a standardized protocol that simplifies integration, accelerates development, and enhances the capabilities of AI assistants.\n\n### What is Neon MCP server?\n\n**Neon MCP Server** acts as the **Server** in the MCP architecture, specifically designed for Neon. It provides a set of **tools** that MCP Clients (like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor) can utilize to manage Neon resources. This includes actions for project management, branch management, executing SQL queries, and handling database migrations, all driven by natural language requests.\n\n**Key Benefits of using Neon MCP Server:**\n\n- **Natural language interaction:** Manage Neon databases using intuitive, conversational commands.\n- **Simplified database management:** Perform complex actions without writing SQL or directly using the Neon API.\n- **Enhanced Productivity:** Streamline workflows for database administration and development.\n- **Accessibility for non-developers:** Empower users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.\n- **Database migration support:** Leverage Neon's branching capabilities for database schema changes initiated via natural language.\n\n<Admonition type=\"important\" title=\"Security Considerations\">\nThe Neon MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests.  **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP server and Neon API keys.\n</Admonition>\n\n## Setup options\n\nYou can set up the Neon MCP Server in two ways:\n\n### Remote hosted server (preview)\n\nYou can use Neon's managed MCP server, available at `https://mcp.neon.tech`. This is the **easiest** way to start using the Neon MCP Server. It streamlines the setup process by utilizing OAuth for authentication, eliminating the need to manage Neon API keys directly in your client configuration.\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\nThe remote hosted MCP server is currently in its preview phase. As the [OAuth specification for MCP](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/) is still quite new, we are releasing it in this preview state. During the initial weeks, you may experience some adjustments to the setup. However, the instructions provided should be straightforward to follow at this time.\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Prerequisites:\n\n- An MCP Client application (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cline, Zed).\n- A Neon account.\n\n<Admonition type=\"tip\" title=\"Install in a single click for Cursor users\">\nClick the button below to install the Neon MCP server in Cursor. When prompted, click **Install** within Cursor.\n\n<a href=\"cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Neon&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5uZW9uLnRlY2gvbWNwIn0%3D\"><img src=\"https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg\" alt=\"Add Neon MCP server to Cursor\" height=\"32\" /></a>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n#### Setup steps:\n\n1.  Go to your MCP Client's settings where you configure MCP Servers (this varies by client)\n2.  Register a new MCP Server. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under 'mcpServers' key. The configuration should look like this:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"Neon\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This command uses `npx` to run a [small helper (`mcp-remote`)](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) that connects to Neon's hosted server endpoint (`https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp`).\n\n    MCP supports two remote server transports: the deprecated Server-Sent Events (SSE) and the newer, recommended Streamable HTTP. If your LLM client doesn't support Streamable HTTP yet, you can switch the endpoint from `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` to `https://mcp.neon.tech/sse` to use SSE instead.\n\n3.  Save the configuration and **restart or refresh** your MCP client application.\n4.  The first time the client initializes Neon's MCP server, it should trigger an **OAuth flow**:\n    - Your browser will open a Neon page asking you to authorize the \"Neon MCP Server\" to access your Neon account.\n    - Review the requested permissions and click **Authorize**.\n    - You should see a success message, and you can close the browser tab.\n5.  Your MCP client should now be connected to the Neon Remote MCP Server and ready to use.\n\n### Local MCP Server\n\nYou can install Neon MCP server locally using `npm`.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- **Node.js (>= v18.0.0):** Ensure Node.js version 18 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n- **Neon API Key:** You will need a Neon API key to authenticate the Neon MCP Server with your Neon account. You can create one from the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/app/settings/api-keys) under your Profile settings. Refer to the [Neon documentation on API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys) for detailed instructions.\n\nOpen your MCP client application and navigate to the settings where you can configure MCP servers. The location of these settings may vary depending on your client. Add a configuration block for \"Neon\" under the `mcpServers` key. Your configuration should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Admonition type=\"note\">\n\nIf you are using Windows and encounter issues while adding the MCP server, you might need to use the Command Prompt (`cmd`) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (`wsl`) to run the necessary commands. Your configuration setup may resemble the following:\n\n<CodeTabs labels={[\"Windows\", \"Windows (WSL)\"]}>\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"cmd\",\n            \"args\": [\"/c\", \"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"mcpServers\": {\n          \"neon\": {\n            \"command\": \"wsl\",\n            \"args\": [\"npx\", \"-y\", \"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon\", \"start\", \"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n  </CodeTabs>\n\n</Admonition>\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your client does not use `JSON` for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>\n```\n\n<MCPTools />\n\n## Usage examples\n\nAfter setting up either the remote or local server and connecting your MCP client, you can start interacting with your Neon databases using natural language.\n\n**Example interactions**\n\n- **List projects:** `\"List my Neon projects\"`\n- **Create a new project:** `\"Create a Neon project named 'my-test-project'\"`\n- **List tables in a database:** `\"What tables are in the database 'my-database' in project 'my-project'?\"`\n- **Add a column to a table:** `\"Add a column 'email' of type VARCHAR to the 'users' table in database 'main' of project 'my-project'\"`\n- **Run a query:** `\"Show me the first 10 rows from the 'users' table in database 'my-database'\"`\n\n<Video  \nsources={[{src: \"/videos/pages/doc/neon-mcp.mp4\",type: \"video/mp4\",}]}\nwidth={960}\nheight={1080}\n/>\n\nYou can also refer to our individual guides for detailed examples on using the Neon MCP Server with specific MCP clients:\n\n- [Claude Desktop](/guides/neon-mcp-server)\n- [Cursor](/guides/cursor-mcp-neon)\n- [Cline](/guides/cline-mcp-neon)\n- [Windsurf (Codium)](/guides/windsurf-mcp-neon)\n- [Zed](/guides/zed-mcp-neon)\n\n## API key-based authentication\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports API key-based authentication for remote access, in addition to OAuth. This allows for simpler authentication using your [Neon API key (personal or organization)](/docs/manage/api-keys) for programmatic access. API key configuration is shown below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Neon\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer <$NEON_API_KEY>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Currently, only [streamable HTTP](#streamable-http-support) responses are supported with API-key based authentication. Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses are not yet supported for this authentication method.\n\n## Streamable HTTP support\n\nThe Neon MCP Server supports streamable HTTP as an alternative to Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses. This makes it easier to consume streamed data in environments where SSE is not ideal — such as CLI tools, backend services, or AI agents. To use streamable HTTP, make sure to use the latest remote MCP server, and specify the `https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp` endpoint, as shown in the following configuration example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"neon\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-remote@latest\", \"https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MCP security guidance\n\nThe Neon MCP server provides access to powerful tools for interacting with your Neon database—such as `run_sql`, `create_table`, `update_row`, and `delete_table`. MCP tools are useful in development and testing, but **we do not recommend using MCP tools in production environments**.\n\n### Recommended usage\n\n- Use MCP only for **local development** or **IDE-based workflows**.\n- Never connect MCP agents to production databases.\n- Avoid exposing production data or PII data to MCP — only use anonymized data.\n- Disable MCP tools capable of accessing or modifying data when they are not being used.\n- Only grant MCP access to trusted users.\n\n### Human oversight and access control\n\n- **Always review and authorize actions** requested by the LLM before execution. The MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests, so human oversight is essential.\n- **Restrict access** to ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP Server and associated API keys.\n- **Monitor usage** and regularly audit who has access to your MCP server configurations and Neon API keys.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized actions when working with Neon's MCP Server.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Neon MCP Server enables natural language interaction with Neon Postgres databases, offering a simplified way to perform database management tasks. You can perform actions such as creating new Neon projects and databases, managing branches, executing SQL queries, and making schema changes, all through conversational requests. Features like branch-based migrations contribute to safer schema modifications. By connecting your preferred MCP client to the Neon MCP Server, you can streamline database administration and development workflows, making it easier for users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org)\n- [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api)\n- [Neon API Keys](/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys)\n- [Neon MCP server GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon)\n\n<NeedHelp/>\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":184,"oldLines":6,"newStart":184,"newLines":7,"lines":[" You can also refer to our individual guides for detailed examples on using the Neon MCP Server with specific MCP clients:"," "," - [Claude Desktop](/guides/neon-mcp-server)","+- [Claude Code](/guides/claude-code-mcp-neon)"," - [Cursor](/guides/cursor-mcp-neon)"," - [Cline](/guides/cline-mcp-neon)"," - [Windsurf (Codium)](/guides/windsurf-mcp-neon)"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Learn more in [Branch Archiving](/docs/guides/branch-archiving).\n- **Neon RLS**: This feature integrates with third-party **authentication providers** like Auth0, Clerk, and Stack Auth to bring authorization to your code base by leveraging Postgres [Row-Level Security (RLS)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html). [Read the announcement](/blog/introducing-neon-authorize) and [check out the docs](/docs/guides/neon-rls).\n- **Neon on Azure**: You can deploy Neon databases on Azure, starting with the East US 2 region. This marks the first milestone on our Azure roadmap—many more exciting updates are on the way, including deeper integrations with the Azure ecosystem. [Read the announcement](/blog/first-azure-region-available-in-neon).\n- **End-to-end RAG pipelines in Postgres**: Our new and open source [pgrag](/docs/extensions/pgrag) extension lets you create end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in Postgres. There's no need for additional programming languages or libraries. With the functions provided by `pgrag`, you can build a complete RAG pipeline directly within your SQL client.\n- **Support for Analytics with pg_mooncake**: This new extension, brought to the community by [mooncake.dev](https://mooncake.dev/), introduces native columnstore tables with DuckDB execution for _fast_ analytics directly in Postgres. [Read the announcement](https://www.mooncake.dev/blog/pgmooncake-neon).\n- **Datadog integration**: Scale users can now export Neon metrics to Datadog.\n- **Deletion of backup branches created by restore operations**: To help minimize storage and keep your Neon project organized, we added support for deleting obsolete backup branches created by [restore](/docs/guides/branch-restore) operations. Previously, these backup branches could not be removed. [Learn more](/docs/guides/branch-restore#deleting-backup-branches).\n- **Read Replicas on the Free plan**: Read Replicas are now available to all Neon users. [Read the announcement](/blog/create-read-replicas-in-the-free-plan)\n- **ISO27110 & ISO27701 compliance**: These new certifications add to our growing list of compliance achievements. For more about Neon's compliance milestones, see [Compliance](/docs/security/compliance).\n- **Increased limits for Neon projects**: We increased the number of projects included in all our paid plans: Launch (100 projects), Scale (1000 projects), and Business (5000 projects). More projects supports use cases such as database-per-tenant and AI agents. [Read the announcement](/blog/thousands-of-neon-projects-now-included-in-your-pricing-plan).\n- **A new Postgres toolkit for AI agents and test environments**: We recently announced an experimental release of the [@neondatabase/toolkit](https://github.com/neondatabase/toolkit). This toolkit lets you spin up a Postgres database in seconds and run SQL queries. It includes both the [Neon API Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/api-client) and the [Neon Serverless Driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless), making it an excellent choice for AI agents that need to quickly set up an SQL database, or for test environments where manually deploying a new database isn't practical. To learn more, see [Why we built @neondatabase/toolkit](/blog/why-neondatabase-toolkit).\n- **Postgres 17**: You can now run the very latest version of Postgres on Neon. [Read the announcement](/blog/postgres-17).\n- **SQL Editor AI features**: We added AI features to the Neon SQL Editor, including SQL generation, AI-generated query names, and an AI assistant that will fix your queries. [Learn more](/docs/get-started/query-with-neon-sql-editor#ai-features).\n- **Data migration support with inbound logical replication**: We've introduced inbound logical replication as the first step toward enabling seamless, low-downtime migrations from your current database provider to Neon. This feature allows you to use Neon as your development environment, taking advantage of developer-friendly tools like branching and our [GitHub integration](/docs/guides/neon-github-integration), even if you keep production with your existing provider. To get started, explore our guides for replicating data from AlloyDB, Aurora, CloudSQL, and RDS. See [Replicate data to Neon](/docs/guides/logical-replication-guide#replicate-data-to-neon). Inbound logical replication also supports migrating data between Neon projects, useful for version, region, or account migrations. See [Replicate data from one Neon project to another](/docs/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).\n\n</details>\n\nFor more of the latest features and fixes, check our [Changelog](/docs/changelog), published weekly.
