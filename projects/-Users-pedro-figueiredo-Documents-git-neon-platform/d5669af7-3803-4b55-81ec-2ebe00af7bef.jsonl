You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```\n\nARGUMENTS: change the design to be more informal, create the plan for this"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"3ec901ef-02a1-49f7-90df-66ec17384408","timestamp":"2025-09-09T17:36:55.644Z"}

Let me compile all the findings:\n\n## Design Pattern Analysis: Current UI Conventions in App.Build\n\nBased on my analysis of the codebase, here are the existing design patterns and UI conventions, with concrete examples showing the current formal/corporate styling that could be made more informal:\n\n### Button Styles and Variants\n**Found in**: `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/packages/design/components/ui/button.tsx:7-40`\n\n```typescript\nconst buttonVariants = cva(\n  \"inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-all disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50\",\n  {\n    variants: {\n      variant: {\n        default: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground shadow-xs hover:bg-primary/90',\n        destructive: 'bg-destructive text-white shadow-xs hover:bg-destructive/90',\n        outline: 'border bg-background shadow-xs hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground',\n        secondary: 'bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground shadow-xs hover:bg-secondary/80',\n        ghost: 'hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground',\n        link: 'text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline',\n      },\n      size: {\n        default: 'h-9 px-4 py-2',\n        sm: 'h-8 rounded-md gap-1.5 px-3',\n        lg: 'h-10 rounded-md px-6',\n        icon: 'size-9',\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n**Current formal pattern**: Very structured, technical class names, precise spacing\n**Could be more informal**: Add playful hover effects, rounded corners, friendly micro-animations\n\n### Color Scheme and Theming\n**Found in**: `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/packages/design/globals.css:44-111`\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --radius: 0.625rem;\n  --background: oklch(1 0 0);\n  --foreground: oklch(0.145 0 0);\n  --primary: oklch(0.205 0 0);\n  --destructive: oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325);\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Uses OKLCH color space (very technical/formal)\n- Monochromatic palette with minimal colors\n- High contrast ratios for accessibility\n- Very systematic approach\n\n### Form Styling Patterns\n**Found in**: `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/packages/design/components/ui/form.tsx:73-154`\n\n```typescript\nfunction FormItem({ className, ...props }: React.ComponentProps<'div'>) {\n  return (\n    <div\n      data-slot=\"form-item\"\n      className={cn('grid gap-2', className)}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nfunction FormMessage({ className, ...props }: React.ComponentProps<'p'>) {\n  return (\n    <p\n      className={cn('text-destructive text-sm', className)}\n      {...props}\n    >\n      {body}\n    </p>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Current formal characteristics**:\n- Clean grid layouts\n- Minimal spacing (`gap-2`)\n- Error states use `text-destructive` (very clinical)\n- Technical data attributes (`data-slot`)\n\n### Modal/Dialog Design\n**Found in**: `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/packages/design/components/ui/dialog.tsx:47-88`\n\n```typescript\nfunction DialogContent({\n  className,\n  children,\n  showCloseButton = true,\n  ...props\n}: React.ComponentProps<typeof DialogPrimitive.Content> & {\n  showCloseButton?: boolean;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <DialogPrimitive.Content\n      className={cn(\n        'bg-background fixed top-[50%] left-[50%] z-50 grid w-full max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)] translate-x-[-50%] translate-y-[-50%] gap-4 rounded-lg border p-6 shadow-lg duration-200 sm:max-w-lg',\n        className,\n      )}\n      {...props}\n    >\n      {children}\n      {showCloseButton && (\n        <DialogPrimitive.Close className=\"absolute top-4 right-4 rounded-xs opacity-70\">\n          <XIcon />\n          <span className=\"sr-only\">Close</span>\n        </DialogPrimitive.Close>\n      )}\n    </DialogPrimitive.Content>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Current formal aspects**:\n- Precise positioning (`top-[50%] left-[50%]`)\n- Generic close button with technical `sr-only` text\n- Very systematic animations (`duration-200`)\n- Clean but impersonal styling\n\n### Alert/Notification Patterns\n**Found in**: `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/packages/design/components/ui/alert.tsx:6-66`\n\n```typescript\nconst alertVariants = cva(\n  'relative w-full rounded-lg border px-4 py-3 text-sm',\n  {\n    variants: {\n      variant: {\n        default: 'bg-card text-card-foreground',\n        destructive: 'text-destructive bg-card [&>svg]:text-current',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\n**Current formal messaging in error handling**:\n**Found in**: `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/error-message.tsx:7-18`\n\n```typescript\nexport function ErrorMessage({ message }: ErrorMessageProps) {\n  return (\n    <Card variant=\"error\">\n      <CardHeader icon=\"❌\" title=\"Error occurred\" variant=\"error\" />\n      <CardContent>\n        <div className=\"text-sm text-red-700\">\n          {message || 'Something went wrong. Please try again later.'}\n        </div>\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Language/Tone Examples\n\n#### Current Formal/Corporate Language:\n**Login Page** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/admin/src/components/admin/login-page.tsx:42-45`):\n```typescript\n<h1 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight\">Sign in</h1>\n<p className=\"text-sm leading-none text-muted-foreground\">\n  Try janedoe@acme.com / password\n</p>\n```\n\n**Home Page** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/web/src/pages/home/public-home.tsx:31-35`):\n```typescript\n<HeroTitle>\n  An open-source <br />\n  AI agent that builds <br />\n  full-stack apps\n</HeroTitle>\n```\n\n**Error Messages** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/cli/src/components/shared/display/error-message.tsx:25-26`):\n```typescript\n<Text color={'redBright'}>\n  <Text>X</Text> <Text>{errorMessage}</Text>\n```\n\n#### Current Success Messages:\n**CLI Success** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/cli/src/components/shared/display/success-message.tsx:23-24`):\n```typescript\n<Text color={'greenBright'}>\n  <Text>✓</Text> <Text>{successMessage}</Text>\n</Text>\n```\n\n### Card Component Variants\n**Found in**: `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/web/src/components/shared/card/card.tsx:28-78`\n\n```typescript\nconst variantStyles = {\n  default: {\n    container: 'border-border hover:border-input',\n    header: 'bg-gradient-to-r from-muted to-background',\n    title: 'text-foreground',\n  },\n  error: {\n    container: 'border-red-200 hover:border-red-300',\n    header: 'bg-red-50 border-b border-red-200',\n    title: 'text-red-800',\n  },\n  success: {\n    container: 'border-green-200 hover:border-green-300',\n    header: 'bg-green-50 border-b border-green-200',\n    title: 'text-green-800',\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Typography Patterns\n\n**Hero Title** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/web/src/pages/home/public-home.tsx:43-60`):\n```typescript\n<p className=\"text-hero-paragraph mt-20 px-5 font-mono text-foreground\">\n  <span className=\"bg-primary pb-px text-white\">\n    app.build\n  </span>{' '}\n  creates real apps from scratch on top of the{' '}\n  <Link to=\"http://neon.com\" target=\"_blank\" className=\"underline\">\n    Neon\n  </Link>{' '}\n  platform.\n</p>\n```\n\n### Current Design System Summary\n\n**Strengths of Current Design**:\n- Very consistent and systematic\n- Strong accessibility focus\n- Clean, professional aesthetic\n- Well-structured component API\n\n**Areas That Feel Too Formal/Corporate**:\n1. **Color Palette**: Very monochromatic, technical color definitions\n2. **Language**: \"Sign in\", \"Error occurred\", \"Something went wrong\"\n3. **Animations**: Minimal, clinical transitions\n4. **Icons**: Generic symbols (❌, ✓, X)\n5. **Spacing**: Very precise, mathematical (`gap-2`, `px-4`, `py-3`)\n6. **Typography**: Heavy use of `font-semibold`, very structured\n\n**Opportunities for More Informal Styling**:\n- Warmer color palette with personality\n- Friendlier micro-copy (\"Oops!\" instead of \"Error occurred\")\n- Playful hover states and animations  \n- Custom illustrations instead of generic icons\n- Slightly more generous spacing\n- Mixed font weights for personality\n- Rounded corners and softer edges\n\nThe codebase shows a very mature, systematic design system that prioritizes consistency and professionalism over personality and warmth. All patterns follow strict conventions which makes them feel corporate rather than approachable."}],"totalDurationMs":178386,"totalTokens":69979,"totalToolUseCount":37,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1061,"cache_read_input_tokens":66269,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1061,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2649,"service_tier":"standard"}}}
