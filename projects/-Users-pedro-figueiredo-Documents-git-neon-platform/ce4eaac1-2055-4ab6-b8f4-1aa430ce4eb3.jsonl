You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon.

elements load before interaction\n- Take screenshots at key points for documentation\n\n### Interaction Testing\n- Use appropriate interaction tools: `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_hover`\n- Test both successful interactions and error conditions\n- Fill forms completely using `browser_fill_form` for complex forms\n\n### State Capture\n- Use `browser_snapshot` for accessibility/structure analysis\n- Use `browser_take_screenshot` for visual documentation\n- Capture both initial state and post-interaction states\n\n### Technical Analysis\n- Monitor `browser_network_requests` during key interactions\n- Check `browser_console_messages` for errors or warnings\n- Use `browser_evaluate` to inspect JavaScript state when needed\n\n### Responsive Testing\n- Use `browser_resize` to test different viewport sizes\n- Document how interface adapts to different screen sizes\n- Test key workflows at both desktop and mobile sizes\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n### Thoroughness\n- Test complete user workflows, not just individual components\n- Document both successful paths and error scenarios\n- Capture visual evidence for all major findings\n- Analyze technical implementation alongside user experience\n\n### Accuracy\n- Provide exact steps to reproduce any issues found\n- Include precise error messages and console output\n- Use specific selectors and element descriptions\n- Verify findings through multiple interaction attempts\n\n### Clarity\n- Use clear, descriptive language for non-technical stakeholders\n- Organize findings logically by user flow or feature area\n- Include visual evidence (screenshots) for all major points\n- Provide actionable recommendations, not just problem identification\n\n### Context\n- Consider the application's target users and use cases\n- Analyze consistency with existing design patterns\n- Document integration points with other system components\n- Include relevant technical context for developers\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n### Authentication & Access\n- Handle authentication requirements appropriately\n- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated states when relevant\n- Respect access controls and permissions\n- Document any special setup requirements\n\n### Data Handling\n- Use test data that won't impact production systems\n- Avoid testing with sensitive or personal information\n- Clean up any test data created during analysis\n- Respect privacy and security constraints\n\n### Browser Environment\n- Test in realistic browser environments\n- Consider different browsers if compatibility is a concern\n- Use appropriate viewport sizes for the target audience\n- Document any browser-specific behavior observed\n\n### Documentation Quality\n- Provide enough detail for others to reproduce your analysis\n- Include both technical and user experience perspectives\n- Use screenshots effectively to support written observations\n- Update analysis if interface changes significantly\n\n## What NOT to Do\n\n- Don't make assumptions about functionality without testing it\n- Don't skip error testing and edge case scenarios\n- Don't ignore console errors or network failures\n- Don't analyze interfaces in isolation from user workflows\n- Don't provide recommendations without supporting evidence\n- Don't test against production data or systems inappropriately\n\n## Application-Specific Notes\n\n### For app.build Platform:\n- **Web Application** (main user interface): Focus on chat interactions, app building flows, authentication\n- **Admin Dashboard**: Focus on CRUD operations, data management, user administration\n- **CLI Interface**: Limited browser testing; focus on documentation and static analysis\n- **Authentication**: Uses Stack Auth - test both GitHub OAuth flow and authenticated states\n- **Local Development**: Applications typically run on localhost:5173 (web) and localhost:3001 (admin)\n\nRemember: You're providing actionable insights about how UIs actually work in practice. Combine systematic testing with user experience awareness to deliver comprehensive analysis that helps both developers and stakeholders understand interface behavior."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":420,"cache_read_input_tokens":57676,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":420,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2755,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSocV5B4c3QXehR3AAFQt","type":"assistant","uuid":"04d8c482-4c57-4365-855b-4feddea2c1f0","timestamp":"2025-09-04T15:41:08.756Z"}

This agent complements the existing E2E testing infrastructure by providing live analysis capabilities.\n\n## What Was Created\n\n### UI Analyzer Agent (`.claude/agents/ui-analyzer.md`)\n\nA specialized agent that provides:\n\n- **Live UI Behavior Analysis**: Navigate and interact with web applications to understand real behavior\n- **Visual Interface Documentation**: Capture screenshots and accessibility snapshots  \n- **Interaction Flow Mapping**: Test complete user workflows and document patterns\n- **Technical Context Gathering**: Monitor network requests, console messages, and DOM behavior\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\n#### Browser Automation Tools Used:\n- Navigation: `browser_navigate`, `browser_wait_for`, `browser_tabs`\n- Interaction: `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_hover`, `browser_fill_form` \n- Analysis: `browser_snapshot`, `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_evaluate`\n- Monitoring: `browser_network_requests`, `browser_console_messages`\n- Responsive: `browser_resize` for multi-device testing\n\n#### Analysis Patterns:\n- **New Applications**: Systematic exploration and workflow documentation\n- **Feature Analysis**: Deep dive into specific functionality\n- **Bug Investigation**: Reproduce and diagnose issues with evidence\n- **UX/UI Review**: Comprehensive usability and design analysis\n\n## Integration with Existing Infrastructure\n\n### Complements Existing E2E Testing\n- **Current E2E Tests**: Automated validation and regression testing\n- **UI Analyzer**: Interactive analysis, exploration, and documentation\n- **Shared Context**: Uses same authentication patterns and environment setup\n\n### Application Coverage\n- **Web Application** (`apps/web`): Main user interface with chat and app building\n- **Admin Dashboard** (`apps/admin`): Management interface with CRUD operations  \n- **Shared Components** (`packages/design`): Design system and component library\n- **CLI Interface**: Limited browser analysis; focuses on documentation\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Analyzing Chat Functionality\n```\nTask: Use ui-analyzer to understand how the chat system works in the web application\n\nThe agent would:\n1. Navigate to the web application\n2. Take screenshots of the chat interface\n3. Test message input and submission\n4. Document loading states and response patterns\n5. Analyze network requests to the backend API\n6. Capture different message types (user, agent, error states)\n```\n\n### Debugging Admin Interface Issues\n```\nTask: Use ui-analyzer to investigate reported issues with the admin user management table\n\nThe agent would:\n1. Navigate to the admin dashboard\n2. Reproduce the reported issue step-by-step\n3. Capture screenshots of expected vs actual behavior\n4. Monitor console for JavaScript errors\n5. Analyze network requests for API failures\n6. Document exact reproduction steps\n```\n\n### Documenting User Onboarding Flow\n```\nTask: Use ui-analyzer to document the complete user onboarding experience\n\nThe agent would:\n1. Start with unauthenticated state\n2. Test the GitHub OAuth flow\n3. Document first-time user experience\n4. Capture screenshots of each step\n5. Test error scenarios (failed auth, network issues)\n6. Create comprehensive flow documentation\n```\n\n## Benefits Over Traditional Approaches\n\n### vs Manual Testing\n- **Systematic**: Follows structured analysis patterns\n- **Documented**: Automatically captures visual evidence\n- **Reproducible**: Provides exact steps for reproduction\n- **Comprehensive**: Tests both happy path and edge cases\n\n### vs Static Code Analysis  \n- **Live Behavior**: Sees actual runtime behavior, not just code structure\n- **User Perspective**: Analyzes from end-user experience viewpoint\n- **Integration Testing**: Tests how components work together\n- **Real Performance**: Measures actual loading times and responsiveness\n\n### vs Traditional E2E Tests\n- **Exploratory**: Can discover issues through interactive exploration\n- **Documentation**: Creates human-readable analysis reports\n- **Contextual**: Provides business context alongside technical findings\n- **Flexible**: Can adapt analysis approach based on findings\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Authentication Handling\n- Leverages existing Stack Auth patterns from E2E testing\n- Can test both authenticated and unauthenticated states\n- Uses session storage for efficient auth state management\n\n### Environment Support\n- Works with local development environment (localhost:5173, localhost:3001)\n- Can be configured for staging/production environments\n- Integrates with existing development workflow\n\n### Technical Architecture\n- Built on Playwright MCP server tools for reliable browser automation\n- Follows established agent patterns for consistency\n- Provides structured output formats for documentation\n- Includes comprehensive error handling and debugging guidance\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Agent file created at `.claude/agents/ui-analyzer.md`\n- [ ] Agent follows established pattern with proper YAML frontmatter\n- [ ] All Playwright MCP tools properly referenced in tools list\n\n### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Agent can successfully navigate to web applications\n- [ ] Screenshots and snapshots are captured correctly\n- [ ] User workflow testing produces comprehensive documentation\n- [ ] Technical analysis captures network and console data\n- [ ] Output format provides actionable insights\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n### Potential Extensions:\n- **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare screenshots across code changes\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Add detailed performance metrics and analysis\n- **Accessibility Auditing**: Integrate comprehensive accessibility checking\n- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Extend to test Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility\n- **Integration with Issue Tracking**: Auto-create tickets for discovered issues\n\n### Advanced Capabilities:\n- **AI-Powered Issue Detection**: Use computer vision to detect UI inconsistencies\n- **Automated User Journey Mapping**: Generate complete user flow diagrams\n- **Component Library Analysis**: Analyze design system consistency\n- **Mobile-First Testing**: Enhanced mobile testing patterns\n\n## References\n\n- Original request: UI analyzer agent using Playwright MCP server tools\n- Existing agents: `.claude/agents/` (patterns and structure)\n- E2E testing setup: `apps/web/E2E_TESTING.md`\n- Playwright configuration: `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`\n- Application structure: `apps/web/`, `apps/admin/`, `packages/design/`"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":275,"cache_read_input_tokens":60881,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":275,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1575,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSoca9KF2R3deGqjrW1KT","type":"assistant","uuid":"1d0f3fb5-a51d-4f29-939e-21d2e9cfbf2c","timestamp":"2025-09-04T15:41:46.936Z"}
