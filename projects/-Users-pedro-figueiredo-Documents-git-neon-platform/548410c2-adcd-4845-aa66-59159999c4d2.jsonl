Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent if you need examples of similar implementations\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec-metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level findings answering the user's question]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Finding with reference ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - Connection to other components\n     - Implementation details\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Insights\n     [Patterns, conventions, and design decisions discovered]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Collect and synchronize all latest files and updates from the thoughts directory, then feed their contents into the LLM context to ensure accurate, up-to-date synthesis.\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only operations\n- Consider cross-component connections and architectural patterns\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Encourage sub-agents to find examples and usage patterns, not just definitions\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied\n\nARGUMENTS: I want to show a deployment message to databricks apps deployment for the web.

Here's my analysis:\n\n## Pattern Examples: Deployment Flow Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Async Deployment (Koyeb) - Primary Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/deploy-app.ts:295-338` and `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts`\n**Used for**: Containerized applications deployed to Koyeb with async status polling\n\n```typescript\n// Main deployment orchestration\nexport async function deployApp({\n  appId,\n  appDirectory,\n  databricksMode,\n  templateId,\n}: {\n  appId: string;\n  appDirectory: string;\n  databricksMode: boolean;\n  templateId: TemplateId;\n}) {\n  const currentApp = await db.select().from(apps).where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n  \n  // Check deployment status\n  if (currentApp.deployStatus === DeployStatus.DEPLOYING) {\n    throw new Error(`App ${appId} is already being deployed`);\n  }\n\n  if (databricksMode) {\n    return deployToDatabricks({ appId, appDirectory, currentApp });\n  }\n\n  return deployToKoyeb({ appId, appDirectory, currentApp, templateId });\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **Status management**: Updates `deployStatus` in database throughout process\n- **Docker workflow**: Build → Push to ECR → Deploy to Koyeb\n- **Resource management**: Creates/reuses Koyeb organizations, apps, services\n- **Async nature**: Returns `deploymentId` for status polling\n- **Error handling**: Updates status on failure\n\n### Pattern 2: Sync Deployment (Databricks) - Alternative Approach\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts:22-207`\n**Used for**: Databricks applications with synchronous deployment process\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deployToDatabricks({\n  appId,\n  appDirectory,\n  currentApp,\n}: {\n  appId: string;\n  appDirectory: string;\n  currentApp: Partial<App>;\n}) {\n  // Set status to deploying\n  await db\n    .update(apps)\n    .set({ deployStatus: DeployStatus.DEPLOYING, neonProjectId })\n    .where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n\n  try {\n    // Synchronous deployment steps\n    await checkDatabricksAppExists({ appName, ... });\n    await setupDatabricksAppSecrets({ ... });\n    await exec(`databricks apps deploy ${appName} --source-code-path ...`);\n    \n    // Set status to deployed\n    await db\n      .update(apps)\n      .set({ deployStatus: DeployStatus.DEPLOYED, appUrl })\n      .where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n\n    return { appURL: appUrl, deploymentId: `databricks-${appId}` };\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Set status to failed\n    await db\n      .update(apps)\n      .set({ deployStatus: DeployStatus.FAILED })\n      .where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **Synchronous execution**: All deployment steps complete before returning\n- **Status updates**: DEPLOYING → DEPLOYED/FAILED in single transaction\n- **CLI integration**: Uses Databricks CLI commands\n- **Error handling**: Always updates status on completion/failure\n\n### Pattern 3: Deployment Status Polling - Frontend Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:25-84`\n**Used for**: Real-time status monitoring of async deployments\n\n```typescript\nexport function useDeploymentStatus(\n  deploymentId: string | undefined,\n  messageId?: string,\n  options?: {\n    enabled?: boolean;\n    onSuccess?: (data: DeploymentStatusResponse) => void;\n    onError?: (error: Error) => void;\n  },\n) {\n  return useQuery({\n    queryKey: DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_QUERY_KEY(deploymentId!),\n    queryFn: async () => {\n      const response = await appsService.fetchDeploymentStatus(\n        deploymentId!,\n        messageId,\n      );\n      \n      // Update global state\n      useDeploymentStatusState\n        .getState()\n        .setDeploymentStatus(\n          DEPLOYMENT_STATE_TO_DEPLOY_STATUS[response.type]\n        );\n\n      return response;\n    },\n    enabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false),\n    refetchInterval: (query) => {\n      const data = query.state.data;\n      const error = query.state.error;\n\n      // Stop polling if deployment is complete\n      if (\n        error ||\n        ['HEALTHY', 'ERROR', 'STOPPING'].includes(data?.type ?? '')\n      ) {\n        return false;\n      }\n\n      return 5000; // Poll every 5 seconds\n    },\n    retry: (failureCount, error) => {\n      // Don't retry on auth errors\n      if (error && 'status' in error && [404, 401, 403].includes(error.status)) {\n        return false;\n      }\n      return failureCount < 3;\n    },\n    retryDelay: (attemptIndex) => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000),\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **5-second polling interval**: Balanced between responsiveness and server load\n- **Smart polling termination**: Stops when deployment reaches final state\n- **Exponential backoff**: For retry logic on failures\n- **Error handling**: Different strategies for different error types\n- **Global state management**: Updates Zustand store for UI consistency\n\n### Pattern 4: Server-Side Status Endpoint - API Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:565-624`\n**Used for**: Backend API endpoint for deployment status checks\n\n```typescript\nexport const getKoyebDeploymentEndpoint = async (\n  request: FastifyRequest<{\n    Params: { id: string };\n    Querystring: { messageId?: string };\n  }>,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n) => {\n  try {\n    const { id } = request.params;\n    const { messageId } = request.query;\n\n    // Get user's Koyeb organization\n    const deploymentData = await db\n      .select({ koyebOrgId: deployments.koyebOrgId })\n      .from(deployments)\n      .where(\n        and(\n          eq(deployments.ownerId, request.user.id!),\n          isNull(deployments.deletedAt),\n        ),\n      )\n      .orderBy(desc(deployments.createdAt))\n      .limit(1);\n\n    const userToken = await getOrganizationToken(koyebOrgId);\n    const deploymentChecker = getDeploymentChecker({\n      deploymentId: id,\n      token: userToken,\n    });\n\n    const response = await deploymentChecker();\n\n    // Update message if deployment is complete\n    if (\n      messageId &&\n      (response.type === 'HEALTHY' || response.type === 'ERROR')\n    ) {\n      await updateDeploymentMessage(messageId, response.type, response.message);\n    }\n\n    return reply.send(response);\n  } catch (error) {\n    logger.error('Error getting deployment endpoint', { error });\n    return reply.status(500).send({ message: 'Internal server error' });\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **User isolation**: Filters deployments by user ID\n- **Token management**: Gets organization-specific tokens\n- **Message updates**: Updates chat messages when deployment completes\n- **Error boundaries**: Proper error handling and logging\n\n### Pattern 5: Deployment State Management - Database Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:14-50` and `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:74-89`\n**Used for**: Database schema for deployment tracking\n\n```typescript\nexport const apps = pgTable('apps', {\n  id: uuid('id').primaryKey(),\n  deployStatus: text().default(DeployStatus.PENDING), // pending, deploying, deployed, failed\n  koyebAppId: text(),\n  koyebServiceId: text(), \n  koyebDomainId: text(),\n  neonProjectId: text(),\n  appUrl: text(),\n  databricksApiKey: text(),\n  databricksHost: text(),\n  // ... other fields\n});\n\nexport const deployments = pgTable('deployments', {\n  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),\n  appId: uuid('appId').references(() => apps.id),\n  koyebOrgId: text(),\n  koyebOrgEcrSecretId: text(),\n  koyebOrgName: text(),\n  ownerId: text('userId').notNull(),\n  createdAt: timestamp('createdAt', { withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),\n  deletedAt: timestamp('deletedAt', { withTimezone: true }),\n});\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **Separation of concerns**: Apps table for app data, deployments for infrastructure\n- **Soft delete**: Uses `deletedAt` for cleanup tracking\n- **User isolation**: `ownerId` field for multi-tenant support\n- **Resource tracking**: Stores cloud provider resource IDs\n\n### Testing Patterns\n**Found in**: CLI and web component usage patterns\n**Used for**: Testing deployment flows\n\n```typescript\n// CLI deployment status hook\nexport function useDeploymentStatus(deploymentId: string, signal?: AbortSignal) {\n  const [status, setStatus] = useState<DeploymentStatus | null>(null);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!deploymentId) return;\n    \n    const poll = async () => {\n      try {\n        const data = await getDeploymentStatus(deploymentId, signal);\n        setStatus(data);\n        \n        // Continue polling if still in progress\n        if (!['HEALTHY', 'ERROR'].includes(data.type)) {\n          setTimeout(poll, 3000);\n        }\n      } catch (error) {\n        if (!signal?.aborted) {\n          setStatus({ type: 'ERROR', message: 'Failed to check status', isDeployed: false });\n        }\n      }\n    };\n    \n    poll();\n  }, [deploymentId, signal]);\n  \n  return status;\n}\n```\n\n### Which Pattern to Use?\n\n**Async Pattern (Koyeb)**: \n- Long-running deployments (Docker builds, container deployment)\n- UI needs real-time status updates\n- Complex infrastructure setup required\n\n**Sync Pattern (Databricks)**:\n- Fast deployments that complete quickly\n- CLI-based deployment tools\n- Simpler error handling requirements\n\n**Key Configuration**:\n- **Polling interval**: 5 seconds (web), 3 seconds (CLI)\n- **Retry strategy**: Exponential backoff with max 3 retries\n- **Status states**: `PENDING` → `DEPLOYING` → `DEPLOYED`/`FAILED`\n- **Cleanup**: Soft delete with `deletedAt` timestamp\n\n### Related Utilities\n- `apps/backend/src/deploy/index.ts` - Main deployment exports\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useWatchDeployedStatus.ts` - Deployment completion detection\n- `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/deployment-message.tsx` - UI components\n- `packages/core/types/api.ts` -

Here's my analysis:\n\n## Pattern Examples: Deployment Flow Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Async Deployment (Koyeb) - Primary Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/deploy-app.ts:295-338` and `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts`\n**Used for**: Containerized applications deployed to Koyeb with async status polling\n\n```typescript\n// Main deployment orchestration\nexport async function deployApp({\n  appId,\n  appDirectory,\n  databricksMode,\n  templateId,\n}: {\n  appId: string;\n  appDirectory: string;\n  databricksMode: boolean;\n  templateId: TemplateId;\n}) {\n  const currentApp = await db.select().from(apps).where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n  \n  // Check deployment status\n  if (currentApp.deployStatus === DeployStatus.DEPLOYING) {\n    throw new Error(`App ${appId} is already being deployed`);\n  }\n\n  if (databricksMode) {\n    return deployToDatabricks({ appId, appDirectory, currentApp });\n  }\n\n  return deployToKoyeb({ appId, appDirectory, currentApp, templateId });\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **Status management**: Updates `deployStatus` in database throughout process\n- **Docker workflow**: Build → Push to ECR → Deploy to Koyeb\n- **Resource management**: Creates/reuses Koyeb organizations, apps, services\n- **Async nature**: Returns `deploymentId` for status polling\n- **Error handling**: Updates status on failure\n\n### Pattern 2: Sync Deployment (Databricks) - Alternative Approach\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts:22-207`\n**Used for**: Databricks applications with synchronous deployment process\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deployToDatabricks({\n  appId,\n  appDirectory,\n  currentApp,\n}: {\n  appId: string;\n  appDirectory: string;\n  currentApp: Partial<App>;\n}) {\n  // Set status to deploying\n  await db\n    .update(apps)\n    .set({ deployStatus: DeployStatus.DEPLOYING, neonProjectId })\n    .where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n\n  try {\n    // Synchronous deployment steps\n    await checkDatabricksAppExists({ appName, ... });\n    await setupDatabricksAppSecrets({ ... });\n    await exec(`databricks apps deploy ${appName} --source-code-path ...`);\n    \n    // Set status to deployed\n    await db\n      .update(apps)\n      .set({ deployStatus: DeployStatus.DEPLOYED, appUrl })\n      .where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n\n    return { appURL: appUrl, deploymentId: `databricks-${appId}` };\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Set status to failed\n    await db\n      .update(apps)\n      .set({ deployStatus: DeployStatus.FAILED })\n      .where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **Synchronous execution**: All deployment steps complete before returning\n- **Status updates**: DEPLOYING → DEPLOYED/FAILED in single transaction\n- **CLI integration**: Uses Databricks CLI commands\n- **Error handling**: Always updates status on completion/failure\n\n### Pattern 3: Deployment Status Polling - Frontend Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:25-84`\n**Used for**: Real-time status monitoring of async deployments\n\n```typescript\nexport function useDeploymentStatus(\n  deploymentId: string | undefined,\n  messageId?: string,\n  options?: {\n    enabled?: boolean;\n    onSuccess?: (data: DeploymentStatusResponse) => void;\n    onError?: (error: Error) => void;\n  },\n) {\n  return useQuery({\n    queryKey: DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_QUERY_KEY(deploymentId!),\n    queryFn: async () => {\n      const response = await appsService.fetchDeploymentStatus(\n        deploymentId!,\n        messageId,\n      );\n      \n      // Update global state\n      useDeploymentStatusState\n        .getState()\n        .setDeploymentStatus(\n          DEPLOYMENT_STATE_TO_DEPLOY_STATUS[response.type]\n        );\n\n      return response;\n    },\n    enabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false),\n    refetchInterval: (query) => {\n      const data = query.state.data;\n      const error = query.state.error;\n\n      // Stop polling if deployment is complete\n      if (\n        error ||\n        ['HEALTHY', 'ERROR', 'STOPPING'].includes(data?.type ?? '')\n      ) {\n        return false;\n      }\n\n      return 5000; // Poll every 5 seconds\n    },\n    retry: (failureCount, error) => {\n      // Don't retry on auth errors\n      if (error && 'status' in error && [404, 401, 403].includes(error.status)) {\n        return false;\n      }\n      return failureCount < 3;\n    },\n    retryDelay: (attemptIndex) => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000),\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **5-second polling interval**: Balanced between responsiveness and server load\n- **Smart polling termination**: Stops when deployment reaches final state\n- **Exponential backoff**: For retry logic on failures\n- **Error handling**: Different strategies for different error types\n- **Global state management**: Updates Zustand store for UI consistency\n\n### Pattern 4: Server-Side Status Endpoint - API Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:565-624`\n**Used for**: Backend API endpoint for deployment status checks\n\n```typescript\nexport const getKoyebDeploymentEndpoint = async (\n  request: FastifyRequest<{\n    Params: { id: string };\n    Querystring: { messageId?: string };\n  }>,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n) => {\n  try {\n    const { id } = request.params;\n    const { messageId } = request.query;\n\n    // Get user's Koyeb organization\n    const deploymentData = await db\n      .select({ koyebOrgId: deployments.koyebOrgId })\n      .from(deployments)\n      .where(\n        and(\n          eq(deployments.ownerId, request.user.id!),\n          isNull(deployments.deletedAt),\n        ),\n      )\n      .orderBy(desc(deployments.createdAt))\n      .limit(1);\n\n    const userToken = await getOrganizationToken(koyebOrgId);\n    const deploymentChecker = getDeploymentChecker({\n      deploymentId: id,\n      token: userToken,\n    });\n\n    const response = await deploymentChecker();\n\n    // Update message if deployment is complete\n    if (\n      messageId &&\n      (response.type === 'HEALTHY' || response.type === 'ERROR')\n    ) {\n      await updateDeploymentMessage(messageId, response.type, response.message);\n    }\n\n    return reply.send(response);\n  } catch (error) {\n    logger.error('Error getting deployment endpoint', { error });\n    return reply.status(500).send({ message: 'Internal server error' });\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **User isolation**: Filters deployments by user ID\n- **Token management**: Gets organization-specific tokens\n- **Message updates**: Updates chat messages when deployment completes\n- **Error boundaries**: Proper error handling and logging\n\n### Pattern 5: Deployment State Management - Database Pattern\n**Found in**: `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:14-50` and `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:74-89`\n**Used for**: Database schema for deployment tracking\n\n```typescript\nexport const apps = pgTable('apps', {\n  id: uuid('id').primaryKey(),\n  deployStatus: text().default(DeployStatus.PENDING), // pending, deploying, deployed, failed\n  koyebAppId: text(),\n  koyebServiceId: text(), \n  koyebDomainId: text(),\n  neonProjectId: text(),\n  appUrl: text(),\n  databricksApiKey: text(),\n  databricksHost: text(),\n  // ... other fields\n});\n\nexport const deployments = pgTable('deployments', {\n  id: uuid('id').defaultRandom().primaryKey(),\n  appId: uuid('appId').references(() => apps.id),\n  koyebOrgId: text(),\n  koyebOrgEcrSecretId: text(),\n  koyebOrgName: text(),\n  ownerId: text('userId').notNull(),\n  createdAt: timestamp('createdAt', { withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),\n  deletedAt: timestamp('deletedAt', { withTimezone: true }),\n});\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- **Separation of concerns**: Apps table for app data, deployments for infrastructure\n- **Soft delete**: Uses `deletedAt` for cleanup tracking\n- **User isolation**: `ownerId` field for multi-tenant support\n- **Resource tracking**: Stores cloud provider resource IDs\n\n### Testing Patterns\n**Found in**: CLI and web component usage patterns\n**Used for**: Testing deployment flows\n\n```typescript\n// CLI deployment status hook\nexport function useDeploymentStatus(deploymentId: string, signal?: AbortSignal) {\n  const [status, setStatus] = useState<DeploymentStatus | null>(null);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!deploymentId) return;\n    \n    const poll = async () => {\n      try {\n        const data = await getDeploymentStatus(deploymentId, signal);\n        setStatus(data);\n        \n        // Continue polling if still in progress\n        if (!['HEALTHY', 'ERROR'].includes(data.type)) {\n          setTimeout(poll, 3000);\n        }\n      } catch (error) {\n        if (!signal?.aborted) {\n          setStatus({ type: 'ERROR', message: 'Failed to check status', isDeployed: false });\n        }\n      }\n    };\n    \n    poll();\n  }, [deploymentId, signal]);\n  \n  return status;\n}\n```\n\n### Which Pattern to Use?\n\n**Async Pattern (Koyeb)**: \n- Long-running deployments (Docker builds, container deployment)\n- UI needs real-time status updates\n- Complex infrastructure setup required\n\n**Sync Pattern (Databricks)**:\n- Fast deployments that complete quickly\n- CLI-based deployment tools\n- Simpler error handling requirements\n\n**Key Configuration**:\n- **Polling interval**: 5 seconds (web), 3 seconds (CLI)\n- **Retry strategy**: Exponential backoff with max 3 retries\n- **Status states**: `PENDING` → `DEPLOYING` → `DEPLOYED`/`FAILED`\n- **Cleanup**: Soft delete with `deletedAt` timestamp\n\n### Related Utilities\n- `apps/backend/src/deploy/index.ts` - Main deployment exports\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useWatchDeployedStatus.ts` - Deployment completion detection\n- `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/deployment-message.tsx` - UI components\n- `packages/core/types/api.ts` - Shared type definitions\n\n## Plan Summary\n\nI've comprehensively analyzed the deployment flow patterns in the codebase and found well-established patterns for:\n\n1. **Async deployments (Koyeb)** - Container-based with polling\n2. **Sync deployments (Databricks)** - CLI-based with immediate completion\n3. **Status polling mechanisms** - 5-second intervals with smart termination\n4. **Database state management** - Separate tables for apps and deployments\n5. **Frontend integration** - React Query hooks with global state\n\nThe patterns show a mature deployment system with proper error handling, user isolation, and real-time status updates. The async pattern is the primary approach for most deployments, while the sync pattern is used for specific platforms like Databricks."}],"totalDurationMs":113629,"totalTokens":45846,"totalToolUseCount":16,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":42813,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3033,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

Let me synthesize my findings:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n**Problem Identified:**\nThe user wants to show deployment messages for Databricks apps, but the current system:\n1. Uses polling designed for Koyeb (async deployments)\n2. Doesn't properly handle Databricks apps (sync deployments)\n3. Has a mismatch between sync vs async deployment patterns\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n\n**Koyeb (Async Pattern):**\n- Located in: `apps/cli/src/hooks/use-deployment-status.ts`\n- Uses 5-second polling intervals\n- Status flow: PENDING → DEPLOYING → DEPLOYED/FAILED\n- Designed for long-running container deployments\n- Has proper UI integration with `DeploymentMessage` component\n\n**Databricks (Sync Pattern):**\n- Located in: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts`\n- Synchronous deployment that completes immediately\n- Uses CLI commands directly\n- Status updates happen in single transaction\n- Returns immediately with final status\n\n**The Problem:**\n- The deployment status polling hook (`use-deployment-status.ts`) is designed for Koyeb's async pattern\n- It polls every 5 seconds expecting status changes over time\n- But Databricks deployments complete synchronously, so there's nothing to poll\n- The UI expects polling behavior but Databricks doesn't need it\n- Users see Koyeb-style loading states for what should be instant Databricks results\n\n## Plan to Fix\n\nI'll create a plan to address this architectural mismatch and provide proper deployment messaging for both deployment types.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":13,"cache_creation_input_tokens":317,"cache_read_input_tokens":52983,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":317,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbtCwoBBhctKiNFtTAzR","type":"assistant","uuid":"0379ab9b-2f99-4fd6-b2fd-2fa9c64ca604","timestamp":"2025-08-29T10:59:20.143Z"}

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### ✅ **Problem Solved**\nThe original issue was that the deployment system was using Koyeb's async polling pattern for Databricks sync deployments, causing users to see loading states for deployments that complete instantly.\n\n### ✅ **Key Changes Made**\n\n**1. Enhanced Web Deployment Status Hook (`apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts`)**\n- Added `deploymentType?: 'databricks' | 'koyeb'` parameter\n- Only enables polling for Koyeb deployments (`options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb'`)\n- Databricks deployments skip polling entirely\n\n**2. Updated Deployment Message Component (`apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/deployment-message.tsx`)**\n- Extracts `deploymentType` from metadata\n- Passes deployment type to the status hook\n- Updated state determination logic to handle both types\n\n**3. Enhanced Deployment State Utils (`apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/utils.ts`)**\n- Added deployment type awareness to `determineDeploymentState()`\n- Special handling for Databricks deployments that maintain their original state when no polling occurs\n\n**4. Updated API Types (`apps/web/src/external/api/services.ts`)**\n- Added `deploymentType?: 'databricks' | 'koyeb'` to `DeploymentStatusResponse`\n\n**5. Created Generic Backend Endpoint (`apps/backend/src/deploy/generic-deployment-status.ts`)**\n- New generic deployment status endpoint that handles both deployment types\n- **For Databricks**: Queries app status directly from database (sync)\n- **For Koyeb**: Uses existing polling logic (async)\n- Determines deployment type from ID format (`databricks-{appId}` vs Koyeb IDs)\n \nI'll modify the backend infrastructure to streamline deployment status handling. The route modifications ensure a unified approach for both Koyeb and Databricks deployment tracking. By exporting key functions from the Koyeb module, I'm creating a more flexible and reusable deployment management system. This approach simplifies the status retrieval process and provides a consistent experience across different deployment platforms.\n\nThe backend routes will now channel all deployment status requests through a single, generic handler. This centralization reduces complexity and improves maintainability. The exported functions from the Koyeb module will support this new architecture, allowing for easier integration and potential future platform expansions.\n\nFor Koyeb deployments, the system implements a 5-second polling mechanism that enables progressive loading states. Conversely, Databricks deployments leverage direct database querying, eliminating unnecessary network requests and providing immediate status feedback. This differentiated approach optimizes performance and user experience based on deployment type.\n\nThe implementation achieves multiple key objectives: enhanced performance, improved user experience, type-safe handling, and complete backward compatibility with existing deployment workflows.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":344,"cache_read_input_tokens":87497,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":344,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbtdoy5nKK1ai5r3LkTN","type":"assistant","uuid":"eae01d2c-6b14-46e0-bf26-79e2bfc868dc","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:05:06.579Z"}

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n   - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n   - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```\n\nARGUMENTS: I want to change the databricks deployment status to be async, so it doesnt block generation. So we will need to poll the status the same way we are doing with koyeb."}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"546584b2-511f-4d77-84ea-4f52e7d1ee39","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:06:21.614Z"}

Synchronous Deployment in Message Handler (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:767-778`)\n```typescript\nconst deployResult = await writeMemfsToTempDir(memfsVolume, virtualDir)\n  .then((tempDirPath) =>\n    deployApp({\n      appId: applicationId!,\n      appDirectory: tempDirPath,\n      databricksMode: Boolean(requestBody.databricksHost),\n      templateId,\n    }),\n  )\n```\n**BLOCKING ISSUE**: This `await` call blocks the entire message processing until deployment completes.\n\n#### 2. Sequential Databricks CLI Operations (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts`)\n\n**Slow Operations (all synchronous):**\n\n- **Lines 40-42**: Neon database creation/retrieval API calls\n- **Lines 74-88**: Check if Databricks app exists via CLI: `databricks apps list | grep ${appName}`\n- **Lines 85-87**: Create Databricks app: `databricks apps create ${appName}`\n- **Lines 92-112**: Check and create secret scopes via API calls\n- **Lines 328-337**: Create secret scope: `databricks secrets create-scope ${scopeName}`\n- **Lines 350-366**: Add secrets to scope: `databricks secrets put-secret --json`\n- **Lines 146-152**: Import code to workspace: `databricks workspace import-dir --overwrite`\n- **Lines 156-162**: Deploy app: `databricks apps deploy ${appName} --source-code-path`\n- **Lines 169-172**: Get app URL: `databricks apps get ${appName} | jq -r '.url'`\n\n#### 3. Database Status Updates Block Stream Completion\n- **Line 45-51**: Sets status to `DEPLOYING` before starting\n- **Line 175-181**: Updates to `DEPLOYED` only after completion\n- **Line 957**: `await messageHandlerQueue.waitForCompletion(streamLog)` - **CRITICAL BLOCKING POINT**\n\n### Data Flow - Where Blocking Occurs\n\n1. **Agent completes generation** → `apps/message.ts:650` - `canDeploy = true`\n2. **Deployment starts synchronously** → `apps/message.ts:772` - `deployApp()` awaited\n3. **All Databricks operations run sequentially** → `deploy/databricks.ts:22-206`\n4. **Stream waits for message queue** → `apps/message.ts:957` - `waitForCompletion()`\n5. **Only then does stream finish** → `apps/message.ts:974-980`\n\n### Message Queue System - The Core Problem\n\n#### Queue Processing (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts`)\n- **Lines 87-118**: `waitForCompletion()` has a **1,000,000ms timeout** (16+ minutes)\n- **Line 89 comment**: \"This is a large timeout to allow for long-running deployments to databricks\"\n- **Lines 98-100**: Polls every 100ms until queue is empty\n\n#### The Blocking Mechanism\nThe deployment is enqueued as a message handler at `apps/message.ts:898`, but the stream cannot finish until:\n1. All handlers in the queue complete (`message-queue.ts:98-100`)\n2. The deployment successfully finishes (`databricks.ts:175-181`)\n3. Database status is updated to `DEPLOYED`\n\n### Deployment Status Communication\n\n#### Current Status Updates\n- **Line 828-848**: Sends `DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS` platform message immediately\n- **Line 93**: `/deployment-status/:id` endpoint polls database status\n- **Lines 84-116**: Returns status based on database `deployStatus` field\n\n#### No Asynchronous Processing\n- No background job system exists\n- No webhook callbacks from Databricks\n- No polling of actual Databricks deployment status\n- Status only updates when the synchronous deployment completes or fails\n\n### Key Patterns Causing Blocking\n\n1. **Synchronous Execution**: All deployment operations run in the same thread as message processing\n2. **Sequential CLI Commands**: Each Databricks CLI call must complete before the next\n3. **Queue-Based Completion**: Stream cannot finish until deployment queue is empty\n4. **No Background Processing**: No worker threads, job queues, or async deployment system\n\n### Time-Consuming Operations\n\n**Databricks CLI Commands (slowest):**\n- `databricks apps create` - Can take 30+ seconds\n- `databricks workspace import-dir` - Uploads all files, can take 60+ seconds\n- `databricks apps deploy` - Actual deployment, can take 2-5 minutes\n- `databricks apps get` - Final URL retrieval\n\n**API Calls:**\n- Neon database creation/connection (`neon.ts:27-33`) - 5-10 seconds\n- Databricks secret management (`databricks.ts:328-366`) - 10-30 seconds per operation\n\n### Configuration\n- **Message Queue Timeout**: 1,000,000ms (16.67 minutes) at `message-queue.ts:90`\n- **Database Status**: Tracked in `apps.deployStatus` field (`db/schema.ts:28`)\n- **Environment Variables**: Databricks host/token from request body (`message.ts:84-85`)\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the entire deployment process runs synchronously within the message generation flow, with no background processing or asynchronous deployment capabilities. The stream cannot complete until every CLI command and API call in the Databricks deployment sequence finishes successfully."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1654,"cache_read_input_tokens":45592,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1654,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1606,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbtz3WyXgTddiLBEg56M","type":"assistant","uuid":"c00fd3b7-0761-4fa7-8a08-79bae1654a98","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:10:01.296Z"}

The deployment process runs to completion synchronously, but Koyeb deployments require additional time after API completion to become \"HEALTHY\", so the system uses frontend polling to track the final deployment state.\n\n### Entry Points\n- `apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:772` - Main deployment trigger in SSE message handler\n- `apps/backend/src/deploy/deploy-app.ts:296` - Core deployment orchestration function  \n- `apps/backend/src/index.ts:93` - GET `/deployment-status/:id` endpoint for status polling\n\n### Core Implementation\n\n#### 1. Deployment Execution (`apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:767-778`)\n**Synchronous Pattern**: The deployment runs to completion before returning control:\n```typescript\nconst deployResult = await writeMemfsToTempDir(memfsVolume, virtualDir)\n  .then((tempDirPath) =>\n    deployApp({\n      appId: applicationId!,\n      appDirectory: tempDirPath,\n      databricksMode: Boolean(requestBody.databricksHost),\n      templateId,\n    }),\n  )\n```\n\n#### 2. Deployment ID Generation (`deploy/koyeb.ts:268` and `deploy/databricks.ts:185`)\n- **Koyeb**: Returns real Koyeb deployment ID from API: `data?.service?.latest_deployment_id`\n- **Databricks**: Returns synthetic ID: `databricks-${appId}`\n\n#### 3. Database State Updates (`deploy/deploy-app.ts:258-266`)\nImmediate database update after Koyeb API completion:\n```typescript\nawait db\n  .update(apps)\n  .set({\n    flyAppId: koyebAppName,\n    koyebAppId,\n    koyebServiceId,\n    koyebDomainId,\n    deployStatus: DeployStatus.DEPLOYED, // Set to DEPLOYED immediately\n  })\n  .where(eq(apps.id, appId));\n```\n\n#### 4. Message Creation (`apps/message.ts:828-848`)\nAfter deployment completes, creates a DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS message:\n```typescript\nawait pushAndSavePlatformMessage(\n  session,\n  applicationId,\n  new PlatformMessage(\n    AgentStatus.IDLE,\n    traceId!,\n    applicationId,\n    `Your application is being deployed:`,\n    {\n      type: PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS,\n      deploymentId: deployResult.deploymentId,\n      deploymentUrl: deployResult.appURL,\n      deployStatus: DeployStatus.DEPLOYING,\n      githubUrl: githubEntity.repositoryUrl,\n      deploymentType: requestBody.databricksHost ? 'databricks' : 'koyeb',\n    },\n  ),\n  userId,\n);\n```\n\n### Polling Infrastructure\n\n#### 1. Frontend Polling Hook (`apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:35-90`)\n- **Polling Trigger**: Only polls when `type === PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS`\n- **Koyeb Only**: Line 57 shows polling disabled for Databricks: `options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb'`\n- **Polling Interval**: 5 seconds (`refetchInterval: 5000`)\n- **Stop Conditions**: Stops when status is `['HEALTHY', 'ERROR', 'STOPPING']`\n\n#### 2. Status Endpoint (`generic-deployment-status.ts:19-53`)\nRoutes to different handlers based on deployment ID format:\n- **Databricks**: ID starts with `databricks-` → reads from database\n- **Koyeb**: Everything else → calls Koyeb API\n\n#### 3. Koyeb Status Checker (`koyeb.ts:707-778`)\nThe `getDeploymentChecker` function:\n- Calls Koyeb API to get real deployment status\n- Maps status: `HEALTHY` → deployed, `ERROR` → failed, others → in progress\n- Returns standardized response format\n\n### Data Flow\n\n1. **Deployment Trigger**: `message.ts:772` calls `deployApp()`\n2. **Koyeb Deployment**: `deploy-app.ts:39-294` runs Koyeb deployment to completion\n3. **Database Update**: `deploy-app.ts:258` sets `deployStatus: DEPLOYED` immediately\n4. **Message Creation**: `message.ts:828` creates `DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS` message with deploymentId\n5. **Frontend Polling**: `useDeploymentStatus.ts:35` polls `/deployment-status/:id` every 5s\n6. **Status Check**: `generic-deployment-status.ts:133` calls Koyeb API via `getDeploymentChecker`\n7. **Message Update**: `koyeb.ts:616` calls `updateDeploymentMessage` when final status reached\n\n### Key Patterns\n\n#### 1. **Dual Database State** (`schema.ts:28` and `schema.ts:74-89`)\n- **`apps.deployStatus`**: Tracks app-level deployment state (PENDING→DEPLOYING→DEPLOYED)\n- **`deployments` table**: Tracks Koyeb-specific resources (orgId, serviceId, etc.)\n\n#### 2. **Synthetic vs Real Deployment IDs**\n- **Koyeb**: Uses real Koyeb deployment ID for tracking actual infrastructure state\n- **Databricks**: Uses `databricks-${appId}` format, maps to database `deployStatus`\n\n#### 3. **Message State Machine** (`updateDeploymentMessage` in `koyeb.ts:780-821`)\nUpdates message metadata when deployment reaches final state:\n```typescript\nconst newPlatformType =\n  deploymentType === 'HEALTHY'\n    ? PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE\n    : PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n```\n\n### Configuration\n- **Polling Interval**: 5 seconds hardcoded (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:71`)\n- **Stop Conditions**: `['HEALTHY', 'ERROR', 'STOPPING']` (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:66`)\n- **Retry Logic**: Max 3 retries with exponential backoff (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:73-86`)\n\n### Error Handling\n- **Deployment Errors**: Caught and logged at `message.ts:779`, sets app status to FAILED\n- **Polling Errors**: Handled with retry logic and graceful degradation\n- **Message Updates**: `updateDeploymentMessage` has try/catch to avoid breaking polling\n\n### Critical Insight: The Pattern Difference\n\n**Key Finding**: The current implementation is **NOT truly async**. The deployment runs synchronously to completion, then uses polling only to wait for Koyeb's infrastructure to reach \"HEALTHY\" state. This is why:\n\n1. `deployApp()` is awaited fully at `message.ts:772`\n2. Database is updated to `DEPLOYED` immediately at `deploy-app.ts:264`\n3. Polling only tracks the final infrastructure readiness, not the deployment process itself\n\nFor Databricks, this means the current pattern makes the entire deployment synchronous, which explains why polling is disabled for Databricks deployments (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":789,"cache_read_input_tokens":51749,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":789,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1777,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbu2zjd5DmrJGjv6W79u","type":"assistant","uuid":"961ab347-22a6-4abb-b4ce-cab875f4c83b","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:10:41.259Z"}

Message Creation (`apps/message.ts:828-848`)\nAfter deployment completes, creates a DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS message:\n```typescript\nawait pushAndSavePlatformMessage(\n  session,\n  applicationId,\n  new PlatformMessage(\n    AgentStatus.IDLE,\n    traceId!,\n    applicationId,\n    `Your application is being deployed:`,\n    {\n      type: PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS,\n      deploymentId: deployResult.deploymentId,\n      deploymentUrl: deployResult.appURL,\n      deployStatus: DeployStatus.DEPLOYING,\n      githubUrl: githubEntity.repositoryUrl,\n      deploymentType: requestBody.databricksHost ? 'databricks' : 'koyeb',\n    },\n  ),\n  userId,\n);\n```\n\n### Polling Infrastructure\n\n#### 1. Frontend Polling Hook (`apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:35-90`)\n- **Polling Trigger**: Only polls when `type === PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS`\n- **Koyeb Only**: Line 57 shows polling disabled for Databricks: `options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb'`\n- **Polling Interval**: 5 seconds (`refetchInterval: 5000`)\n- **Stop Conditions**: Stops when status is `['HEALTHY', 'ERROR', 'STOPPING']`\n\n#### 2. Status Endpoint (`generic-deployment-status.ts:19-53`)\nRoutes to different handlers based on deployment ID format:\n- **Databricks**: ID starts with `databricks-` → reads from database\n- **Koyeb**: Everything else → calls Koyeb API\n\n#### 3. Koyeb Status Checker (`koyeb.ts:707-778`)\nThe `getDeploymentChecker` function:\n- Calls Koyeb API to get real deployment status\n- Maps status: `HEALTHY` → deployed, `ERROR` → failed, others → in progress\n- Returns standardized response format\n\n### Data Flow\n\n1. **Deployment Trigger**: `message.ts:772` calls `deployApp()`\n2. **Koyeb Deployment**: `deploy-app.ts:39-294` runs Koyeb deployment to completion\n3. **Database Update**: `deploy-app.ts:258` sets `deployStatus: DEPLOYED` immediately\n4. **Message Creation**: `message.ts:828` creates `DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS` message with deploymentId\n5. **Frontend Polling**: `useDeploymentStatus.ts:35` polls `/deployment-status/:id` every 5s\n6. **Status Check**: `generic-deployment-status.ts:133` calls Koyeb API via `getDeploymentChecker`\n7. **Message Update**: `koyeb.ts:616` calls `updateDeploymentMessage` when final status reached\n\n### Key Patterns\n\n#### 1. **Dual Database State** (`schema.ts:28` and `schema.ts:74-89`)\n- **`apps.deployStatus`**: Tracks app-level deployment state (PENDING→DEPLOYING→DEPLOYED)\n- **`deployments` table**: Tracks Koyeb-specific resources (orgId, serviceId, etc.)\n\n#### 2. **Synthetic vs Real Deployment IDs**\n- **Koyeb**: Uses real Koyeb deployment ID for tracking actual infrastructure state\n- **Databricks**: Uses `databricks-${appId}` format, maps to database `deployStatus`\n\n#### 3. **Message State Machine** (`updateDeploymentMessage` in `koyeb.ts:780-821`)\nUpdates message metadata when deployment reaches final state:\n```typescript\nconst newPlatformType =\n  deploymentType === 'HEALTHY'\n    ? PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE\n    : PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n```\n\n### Configuration\n- **Polling Interval**: 5 seconds hardcoded (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:71`)\n- **Stop Conditions**: `['HEALTHY', 'ERROR', 'STOPPING']` (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:66`)\n- **Retry Logic**: Max 3 retries with exponential backoff (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:73-86`)\n\n### Error Handling\n- **Deployment Errors**: Caught and logged at `message.ts:779`, sets app status to FAILED\n- **Polling Errors**: Handled with retry logic and graceful degradation\n- **Message Updates**: `updateDeploymentMessage` has try/catch to avoid breaking polling\n\n### Critical Insight: The Pattern Difference\n\n**Key Finding**: The current implementation is **NOT truly async**. The deployment runs synchronously to completion, then uses polling only to wait for Koyeb's infrastructure to reach \"HEALTHY\" state. This is why:\n\n1. `deployApp()` is awaited fully at `message.ts:772`\n2. Database is updated to `DEPLOYED` immediately at `deploy-app.ts:264`\n3. Polling only tracks the final infrastructure readiness, not the deployment process itself\n\nFor Databricks, this means the current pattern makes the entire deployment synchronous, which explains why polling is disabled for Databricks deployments (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)."}],"totalDurationMs":218124,"totalTokens":54315,"totalToolUseCount":29,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":789,"cache_read_input_tokens":51749,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":789,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1777,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

The current async pattern relies primarily on setTimeout-based polling for deployment status checks.\n\n### Entry Points\n- `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts` - Core in-memory queue implementation\n- `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/index.ts:32` - Fastify schedule plugin registration\n- `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/deploy/generic-deployment-status.ts:19` - Generic deployment status endpoint\n\n### Core Implementation\n\n#### 1. MessageHandlerQueue (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts:10-119`)\n- **In-memory FIFO queue** for processing async functions during SSE sessions\n- **Sequential processing** with `setImmediate()` to avoid blocking the main thread\n- **Error handling** with logging but continued processing\n- **Completion waiting** with configurable timeout (default 1,000,000ms for long Databricks deployments)\n- Used in `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:489` for handling SSE message events\n\n#### 2. Scheduled Tasks Infrastructure (Available but Unused)\n- **@fastify/schedule** plugin registered at `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/index.ts:32`\n- **toad-scheduler** library available in package.json:47 (not currently used)\n- No active scheduled jobs or cron patterns found in codebase\n\n#### 3. Polling-Based Status Checking (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:1011-1103`)\n- **Exponential backoff polling** pattern in `scheduleOrganizationDeletion()`\n- Uses `setTimeout()` with 5-second intervals for up to 30 attempts\n- **Recursive promise chain** for status checking until completion\n- Pattern: `checkStatusAndScheduleNext()` returns promise that schedules next check\n\n#### 4. Server-Sent Events (SSE) Infrastructure\n- **better-sse** library for real-time client updates (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/package.json:39`)\n- **Session-based streaming** in `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:28`\n- **Event logging** to files for debugging (sse_messages-*.log)\n\n### Data Flow for Async Operations\n1. **Request arrives** at `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:134` (postMessage endpoint)\n2. **SSE session created** with `createSession()` at line 226\n3. **MessageHandlerQueue instantiated** at line 489 with stream logger\n4. **Async handlers enqueued** via `messageHandlerQueue.enqueue()` at line 898\n5. **Queue processing** waits for completion at line 957\n6. **Status polling** via `/deployment-status/:id` endpoint for ongoing updates\n\n### Key Patterns\n\n#### 1. In-Memory Queue Pattern\n```typescript\n// From message-queue.ts:19-33\nenqueue(fn: () => Promise<void>, description?: string): void {\n  const id = `${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;\n  this.queue.push({ fn, id, timestamp: Date.now(), description });\n  if (!this.processing) this.startProcessing();\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Polling with Exponential Backoff\n```typescript\n// From koyeb.ts:1022-1070\nreturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    checkStatusAndScheduleNext().then(resolve).catch(reject);\n  }, delay);\n});\n```\n\n#### 3. Database Status Tracking\n- **Apps table** stores `deployStatus` field (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:28`)\n- **Deployment status constants** in `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/packages/core/agent-message.ts:19-25`\n- Status values: `pending`, `deploying`, `deployed`, `failed`, `stopping`\n\n### Configuration\n- **Queue timeout** configured at `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts:90` (1M ms for Databricks)\n- **Polling intervals** hardcoded at `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:1020` (5s delay, 30 max attempts)\n- **Environment variables** for agent host in `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/env.ts`\n\n### Error Handling\n- **Queue failures** logged but don't stop processing (`message-queue.ts:59-68`)\n- **Deployment failures** update database status and send error messages (`databricks.ts:187-206`)\n- **SSE error handling** with session termination (`message.ts:900-943`)\n\n### Available Libraries for Background Processing\n- **@fastify/schedule**: Cron-style scheduling (installed but unused)\n- **toad-scheduler**: Advanced task scheduling (installed but unused) \n- **better-sse**: Real-time updates to clients\n- **Existing patterns**: In-memory queue, polling with backoff, database status tracking\n\n### Reusable Infrastructure for Async Databricks Deployments\n\n#### 1. **MessageHandlerQueue Pattern** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts`)\n- Could be extended for background job processing beyond SSE sessions\n- Already handles error logging and retry logic\n- Timeout configuration supports long-running operations (1M ms)\n\n#### 2. **Database Status Schema** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:28`)\n- Apps table already tracks `deployStatus` with appropriate states\n- Could extend with additional job-specific fields (attempt count, error messages, etc.)\n\n#### 3. **Polling Infrastructure** (`/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:1011-1103`)\n- Proven pattern for long-running deployment status checks\n- Exponential backoff and retry logic already implemented\n- Could be generalized for any background task monitoring\n\n#### 4. **Fastify Schedule Plugin** (Available but unused)\n- Could implement periodic cleanup jobs for failed deployments\n- Useful for retry mechanisms on a schedule\n- Available at `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/index.ts:32`\n\nThe existing infrastructure provides a solid foundation for implementing async Databricks deployments using the established patterns of status tracking, polling, and queue-based processing."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1096,"cache_read_input_tokens":67507,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1096,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1866,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbuQoSLdmEg2WeUtjAHr","type":"assistant","uuid":"3f15a168-1710-49f4-82de-ae9fd9f4b3e5","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:15:38.134Z"}

verify user gets immediate response\n2. **Monitor status endpoint** - check real-time status updates during deployment  \n3. **Verify UI polling** - confirm frontend shows deployment progress\n4. **Test error handling** - trigger deployment failures and verify error reporting\n5. **Concurrent deployments** - start multiple deployments simultaneously\n6. **Health monitoring** - check `/health` endpoint shows job metrics\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Memory Management:\n- Background job manager uses in-memory storage (jobs cleaned up after 1 hour)\n- Job data size limited by deployment parameters (file paths, not file contents)\n- Automatic cleanup prevents unbounded memory growth\n\n### Concurrency:\n- Background jobs process sequentially (avoid resource conflicts)\n- Each deployment runs in isolated async context\n- Database connections pooled to handle concurrent status queries\n\n### Monitoring:\n- Job metrics available via health endpoint\n- Comprehensive logging for job lifecycle events\n- Error tracking with structured logging\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n### Rollout Strategy:\n1. **Phase-by-phase deployment** - each phase can be deployed independently\n2. **Feature flag ready** - can disable async behavior if issues arise\n3. **Backward compatibility** - existing deployments continue to work\n\n### Database Changes:\n- No schema migrations required (uses existing `apps.deployStatus`)\n- Background job storage is in-memory only\n- Status tracking uses existing patterns\n\n### Configuration:\n- No new environment variables required\n- Uses existing Databricks API credentials from request\n- Leverages existing timeout configurations\n\n## References\n\n- Current synchronous implementation: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts:22-206`\n- Message queue patterns: `apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts`\n- Koyeb async pattern: `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:604-624`\n- Frontend polling infrastructure: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:25-84`\n- Database schema: `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:28`"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":828,"cache_read_input_tokens":98147,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":828,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbuVxVSRiLqNLHZe7oS6","type":"assistant","uuid":"86d6d762-86a9-4a67-ae8f-8c9dd6a3f95d","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:17:50.057Z"}

The plan is available at:\n\n**`thoughts/shared/plans/databricks-async-deployment.md`**\n\n## Key Solution Overview\n\n**The Problem**: Databricks deployment blocks message generation for 2-5+ minutes while CLI commands execute synchronously in the message handler.\n\n**The Solution**: Extract deployment to background job system, return immediate response, enable real-time status polling.\n\n### **Architecture Changes**\n\n**Current Flow**:\n```\nAgent generates → BLOCKS on deployment → User gets response (2-5+ min delay)\n```\n\n**New Flow**:\n```  \nAgent generates → User gets immediate response → Deployment in background → Real-time updates\n```\n\n### **5-Phase Implementation**\n\n1. **Background Job Infrastructure** - Create job manager using existing MessageHandlerQueue patterns\n2. **Message Handler Integration** - Route Databricks to async deployment instead of blocking sync\n3. **Database Status Tracking** - Enhance status endpoint to track background job progress  \n4. **Frontend Polling Enablement** - Remove Databricks polling restriction, enable real-time updates\n5. **Error Handling & Cleanup** - Add monitoring, cleanup, and comprehensive error handling\n\n### **Key Benefits**\n\n✅ **Immediate user response** - No more 2-5+ minute blocking  \n✅ **Real-time status updates** - Same polling experience as Koyeb  \n✅ **Leverages existing infrastructure** - Uses proven patterns from MessageHandlerQueue and Koyeb polling  \n✅ **Backward compatibility** - Can be deployed phase-by-phase  \n✅ **Concurrent deployments** - Multiple users can deploy simultaneously  \n\n### **Technical Approach**\n\n- **Background Job Manager**: In-memory job queue with automatic cleanup\n- **Async Wrapper**: `deployToDatabricksAsync()` enqueues job and returns immediately\n- **Enhanced Status Endpoint**: Tracks background job progress in real-time\n- **Frontend Integration**: Enables existing polling hooks for Databricks\n\n## Questions for You:\n\n1. **Phasing**: Does the 5-phase approach make sense, or would you prefer different groupings?\n\n2. **Job Storage**: The plan uses in-memory job storage with cleanup. Would you prefer persistent storage (database) for job tracking?\n\n3. **Concurrency**: The plan processes background jobs sequentially to avoid resource conflicts. Is parallel processing desired?\n\n4. **Monitoring**: The plan adds job metrics to the health endpoint. Any specific monitoring requirements?\n\n5. **Error Recovery**: Should failed deployments have automatic retry logic, or manual retry only?\n\nThe plan includes specific file changes, code examples, and both automated and manual success criteria for each phase. Ready to start implementation, or would you like any adjustments to the approach?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":488,"cache_read_input_tokens":105287,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":488,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":681,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbueacJacbb2K1bbzXhP","type":"assistant","uuid":"cf456944-36fc-469a-8a95-ca3b0d72a55a","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:18:22.970Z"}

You're absolutely right. Looking at the Koyeb pattern, we can do exactly the same thing for Databricks without any background job manager complexity.\n\n## The Real Koyeb Pattern\n\n**Koyeb does this**:\n1. **Synchronously** creates all resources (org, app, service, domain) via API calls\n2. **Immediately** sets database status to `DEPLOYED` \n3. **Returns** a `deploymentId` (the infrastructure deployment ID)\n4. **Frontend polls** the infrastructure readiness (container becoming \"HEALTHY\")\n\n## Databricks Equivalent Pattern\n\n**We can do the same for Databricks**:\n1. **Synchronously** run all Databricks CLI commands (`apps create`, `workspace import`, `apps deploy`)\n2. **Immediately** set database status to `DEPLOYED`  \n3. **Return** a `deploymentId` (`databricks-${appId}`)\n4. **Frontend polls** the actual app readiness via Databricks API\n\n## Simplified Implementation\n\nInstead of my overcomplicated background job manager, we just need:\n\n### 1. Make `deployToDatabricks()` return immediately after CLI completion\n```typescript\n// In databricks.ts - already works, just return the deploymentId\nreturn {\n  appURL: appUrl,\n  deploymentId: `databricks-${appId}`,\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Enable polling infrastructure (like we did in recent changes)\n```typescript\n// In useDeploymentStatus.ts - remove the restriction\nenabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false)\n// No more koyeb-only restriction\n```\n\n### 3. Poll actual Databricks app status\nInstead of just checking database status, poll the real Databricks app:\n```typescript\n// Check if Databricks app is actually running and accessible\nconst status = await exec(`databricks apps get ${appName} --output json`);\n```\n\n**Wait... but isn't the problem that Databricks CLI commands are slow?**\n\nLooking closer at your request - you said the deployment \"blocks generation\". The CLI commands themselves aren't the issue for **generation** - they're the issue for the **user getting a response**.\n\nThe real solution is much simpler: **return the deployment ID immediately** and let the frontend poll, just like Koyeb does.\n\nWould you like me to create a much simpler plan that just:\n1. Ensures Databricks deployment returns quickly with a deployment ID\n2. Enables the existing polling infrastructure  \n3. Polls actual Databricks app status instead of just database status?\n\nThis would be maybe 3 small changes instead of a complex background system!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1640,"cache_read_input_tokens":104807,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1640,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":613,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSbvEDDdfAsNA2CATDQVv","type":"assistant","uuid":"efbfd7b4-996c-41b3-8dc1-61eccd5a6ee9","timestamp":"2025-08-29T11:25:58.539Z"}

Currently, Databricks deployments block the entire SSE message flow for 2-5+ minutes while CLI commands execute, causing poor user experience.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Blocking Behavior\n- **Location**: `apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:772` - `deployApp()` awaited fully\n- **Impact**: User receives no response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n- **Timeout**: 16.67 minute queue timeout at `message-queue.ts:90`\n- **Flow**: Agent generates → **BLOCKS on deployment** → User gets response\n\n### Current Implementation\n- Databricks deployment runs in `deployToDatabricks()` with sequential CLI commands:\n  - `databricks apps create` (30+ seconds)\n  - `databricks workspace import-dir` (60+ seconds) \n  - `databricks apps deploy` (2-5+ minutes)\n  - `databricks apps get` (5-10 seconds)\n\n### Frontend Status\n- Frontend polling **disabled** for Databricks (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- Only Koyeb deployments use polling infrastructure\n- Deployment message component shows static state for Databricks\n\n## Desired End State\n\n### New Flow\nAgent generates → User gets **immediate response** → Deployment happens in background → Real-time status updates\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Backend tests pass: `cd apps/backend && bun test`\n- [ ] Frontend tests pass: `cd apps/web && bun test` \n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Database migrations apply: `cd apps/backend && bun run db:migrate`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status updates in real-time in the UI\n- [ ] Deployment completes successfully in background\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work without blocking each other\n- [ ] Error handling works correctly for failed deployments\n- [ ] Deployment logs are accessible for debugging\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Koyeb deployment behavior (it already works correctly)\n- Not modifying the Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding external job queue systems (Redis, Bull, etc.) \n- Not changing the database schema structure\n- Not modifying agent message generation logic\n- Not changing the deployment message UI components significantly\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse existing infrastructure patterns:\n1. **Background Job Manager**: Extend MessageHandlerQueue pattern for persistent background jobs\n2. **Database Status Tracking**: Use existing `apps.deployStatus` field \n3. **Polling Infrastructure**: Enable existing frontend polling for Databricks\n4. **CLI Command Isolation**: Run Databricks commands in separate process\n\n## Phase 1: Background Job Infrastructure\n\n### Overview\nCreate background job processing system using existing patterns from MessageHandlerQueue and Koyeb polling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

Currently, Databricks deployments block the entire SSE message flow for 2-5+ minutes while CLI commands execute, causing poor user experience.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Blocking Behavior\n- **Location**: `apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:772` - `deployApp()` awaited fully\n- **Impact**: User receives no response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n- **Timeout**: 16.67 minute queue timeout at `message-queue.ts:90`\n- **Flow**: Agent generates → **BLOCKS on deployment** → User gets response\n\n### Current Implementation\n- Databricks deployment runs in `deployToDatabricks()` with sequential CLI commands:\n  - `databricks apps create` (30+ seconds)\n  - `databricks workspace import-dir` (60+ seconds) \n  - `databricks apps deploy` (2-5+ minutes)\n  - `databricks apps get` (5-10 seconds)\n\n### Frontend Status\n- Frontend polling **disabled** for Databricks (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- Only Koyeb deployments use polling infrastructure\n- Deployment message component shows static state for Databricks\n\n## Desired End State\n\n### New Flow\nAgent generates → User gets **immediate response** → Deployment happens in background → Real-time status updates\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Backend tests pass: `cd apps/backend && bun test`\n- [ ] Frontend tests pass: `cd apps/web && bun test` \n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Database migrations apply: `cd apps/backend && bun run db:migrate`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status updates in real-time in the UI\n- [ ] Deployment completes successfully in background\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work without blocking each other\n- [ ] Error handling works correctly for failed deployments\n- [ ] Deployment logs are accessible for debugging\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Koyeb deployment behavior (it already works correctly)\n- Not modifying the Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding external job queue systems (Redis, Bull, etc.) \n- Not changing the database schema structure\n- Not modifying agent message generation logic\n- Not changing the deployment message UI components significantly\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse existing infrastructure patterns:\n1. **Background Job Manager**: Extend MessageHandlerQueue pattern for persistent background jobs\n2. **Database Status Tracking**: Use existing `apps.deployStatus` field \n3. **Polling Infrastructure**: Enable existing frontend polling for Databricks\n4. **CLI Command Isolation**: Run Databricks commands in separate process\n\n## Phase 1: Background Job Infrastructure\n\n### Overview\nCreate background job processing system using existing patterns from MessageHandlerQueue and Koyeb polling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

Currently, Databricks deployments block the entire SSE message flow for 2-5+ minutes while CLI commands execute, causing poor user experience.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Blocking Behavior\n- **Location**: `apps/backend/src/apps/message.ts:772` - `deployApp()` awaited fully\n- **Impact**: User receives no response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n- **Timeout**: 16.67 minute queue timeout at `message-queue.ts:90`\n- **Flow**: Agent generates → **BLOCKS on deployment** → User gets response\n\n### Current Implementation\n- Databricks deployment runs in `deployToDatabricks()` with sequential CLI commands:\n  - `databricks apps create` (30+ seconds)\n  - `databricks workspace import-dir` (60+ seconds) \n  - `databricks apps deploy` (2-5+ minutes)\n  - `databricks apps get` (5-10 seconds)\n\n### Frontend Status\n- Frontend polling **disabled** for Databricks (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- Only Koyeb deployments use polling infrastructure\n- Deployment message component shows static state for Databricks\n\n## Desired End State\n\n### New Flow\nAgent generates → User gets **immediate response** → Deployment happens in background → Real-time status updates\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Backend tests pass: `cd apps/backend && bun test`\n- [ ] Frontend tests pass: `cd apps/web && bun test` \n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Database migrations apply: `cd apps/backend && bun run db:migrate`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status updates in real-time in the UI\n- [ ] Deployment completes successfully in background\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work without blocking each other\n- [ ] Error handling works correctly for failed deployments\n- [ ] Deployment logs are accessible for debugging\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Koyeb deployment behavior (it already works correctly)\n- Not modifying the Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding external job queue systems (Redis, Bull, etc.) \n- Not changing the database schema structure\n- Not modifying agent message generation logic\n- Not changing the deployment message UI components significantly\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse existing infrastructure patterns:\n1. **Background Job Manager**: Extend MessageHandlerQueue pattern for persistent background jobs\n2. **Database Status Tracking**: Use existing `apps.deployStatus` field \n3. **Polling Infrastructure**: Enable existing frontend polling for Databricks\n4. **CLI Command Isolation**: Run Databricks commands in separate process\n\n## Phase 1: Background Job Infrastructure\n\n### Overview\nCreate background job processing system using existing patterns from MessageHandlerQueue and Koyeb polling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

verify user gets immediate response\n2. **Monitor status endpoint** - check real-time status updates during deployment  \n3. **Verify UI polling** - confirm frontend shows deployment progress\n4. **Test error handling** - trigger deployment failures and verify error reporting\n5. **Concurrent deployments** - start multiple deployments simultaneously\n6. **Health monitoring** - check `/health` endpoint shows job metrics\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Memory Management:\n- Background job manager uses in-memory storage (jobs cleaned up after 1 hour)\n- Job data size limited by deployment parameters (file paths, not file contents)\n- Automatic cleanup prevents unbounded memory growth\n\n### Concurrency:\n- Background jobs process sequentially (avoid resource conflicts)\n- Each deployment runs in isolated async context\n- Database connections pooled to handle concurrent status queries\n\n### Monitoring:\n- Job metrics available via health endpoint\n- Comprehensive logging for job lifecycle events\n- Error tracking with structured logging\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n### Rollout Strategy:\n1. **Phase-by-phase deployment** - each phase can be deployed independently\n2. **Feature flag ready** - can disable async behavior if issues arise\n3. **Backward compatibility** - existing deployments continue to work\n\n### Database Changes:\n- No schema migrations required (uses existing `apps.deployStatus`)\n- Background job storage is in-memory only\n- Status tracking uses existing patterns\n\n### Configuration:\n- No new environment variables required\n- Uses existing Databricks API credentials from request\n- Leverages existing timeout configurations\n\n## References\n\n- Current synchronous implementation: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts:22-206`\n- Message queue patterns: `apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts`\n- Koyeb async pattern: `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:604-624`\n- Frontend polling infrastructure: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:25-84`\n- Database schema: `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:28`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":2,"oldLines":320,"newStart":2,"newLines":222,"lines":[" "," ## Overview"," ","-Convert Databricks deployments from synchronous (blocking) to asynchronous (background) processing to prevent blocking message generation.

The issue isn't that Databricks CLI commands need to run in the background - it's that frontend polling is disabled for Databricks, so users don't get real-time feedback during deployment.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Koyeb Pattern (Works Correctly)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Koyeb API calls complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: For polling Koyeb infrastructure readiness  \n- **Frontend polls**: Real-time status updates until infrastructure is `HEALTHY`\n- **User experience**: Immediate response + real-time updates\n\n### Databricks Pattern (Broken)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Databricks CLI commands complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: `databricks-${appId}` format\n- **Frontend polling**: **DISABLED** (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- **User experience**: No response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n\n### The Real Problem\nFrontend polling is explicitly disabled for Databricks:\n```typescript\n// useDeploymentStatus.ts:57\nenabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb')\n```\n\n## Desired End State\n\nSame experience as Koyeb:\n1. **Databricks deployment completes** (CLI commands finish)\n2. **User gets immediate response** with deployment ID  \n3. **Frontend polls** actual Databricks app status\n4. **Real-time updates** until app is verified as running\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Frontend builds: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] Backend compiles: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status polls and updates in real-time  \n- [ ] Status correctly shows when Databricks app is ready\n- [ ] Error handling works for failed deployments\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work correctly\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding background job systems or queues\n- Not modifying database schema\n- Not changing agent message generation logic\n- Not creating new deployment infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nFollow the exact Koyeb pattern:\n1. **Enable polling**: Remove Databricks restriction in frontend hooks\n2. **Poll real status**: Check actual Databricks app readiness (not just database)\n3. **Status mapping**: Map Databricks app states to standard deployment states\n\n## Phase 1: Enable Frontend Polling\n\n### Overview\nRemove the restriction that disables polling for Databricks deployments, enabling the same real-time experience as Koyeb.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Enable Databricks Polling\n**File**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts`\n**Changes**: Remove deployment type restriction\n\n```typescript\n// Modify enabled condition around line 53-58\nenabled: Boolean(\n  deploymentId && \n  options?.enabled !== false\n  // REMOVED: && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb'\n  // Now enables polling for both Koyeb and Databricks\n),\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Deployment State Logic\n**File**: `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/utils.ts`  \n**Changes**: Allow normal polling logic for Databricks\n\n```typescript\n// Modify getDeploymentType function around line 31-35\nfunction getDeploymentType(\n  originalType: PlatformMessageType | undefined,\n  deploymentStatus: DeploymentStatusData,\n  hasPollingError: boolean,\n  deploymentType?: 'databricks' | 'koyeb',\n): PlatformMessageType {\n  // Remove special Databricks handling - let normal polling work\n  // if (deploymentType === 'databricks' && originalType === PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS) {\n  //   return originalType;\n  // }\n\n  if (hasPollingError) {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n  }\n\n  if (deploymentStatus?.type === 'HEALTHY') {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE;\n  }\n\n  if (deploymentStatus?.type === 'ERROR') {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n  }\n\n  return originalType || PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS;\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Frontend builds successfully: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `cd apps/web && bun types:check`\n- [ ] No runtime errors in polling hook\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Databricks deployments start polling immediately\n- [ ] Polling requests hit `/deployment-status/databricks-{appId}` endpoint\n- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Databricks App Status Polling\n\n### Overview\nInstead of just checking database status, poll the actual Databricks app to verify it's running and accessible, matching the Koyeb infrastructure readiness pattern.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Add Databricks Status Checker\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts`\n**Changes**: Add function to check actual Databricks app status\n\n```typescript\nimport { exec as execNative } from 'node:child_process';\nimport { promisify } from 'node:util';\n\nconst exec = promisify(execNative);\n\nexport async function getDatabricksAppStatus({\n  appName,\n  databricksApiKey,\n  databricksHost,\n}: {\n  appName: string;\n  databricksApiKey: string;\n  databricksHost: string;\n}): Promise<{\n  message: string;\n  isDeployed: boolean;\n  type: 'HEALTHY' | 'ERROR' | 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS';\n}> {\n  const databricksEnv = {\n    ...process.env,\n    DATABRICKS_TOKEN: databricksApiKey,\n    DATABRICKS_HOST: databricksHost,\n  };\n\n  try {\n    // Check if app exists and get its status\n    const result = await exec(\n      `databricks apps get ${appName} --output json`,\n      { env: databricksEnv }\n    );\n\n    const appData = JSON.parse(result.stdout);\n    \n    // Check app status - similar to how Koyeb checks deployment health\n    if (appData.status === 'RUNNING' && appData.url) {\n      return {\n        message: 'Databricks app is running and accessible',\n        isDeployed: true,\n        type: 'HEALTHY',\n      };\n    } else if (appData.status === 'FAILED' || appData.status === 'STOPPED') {\n      return {\n        message: `Databricks app status: ${appData.status}`,\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'ERROR',\n      };\n    } else {\n      // Starting, deploying, etc.\n      return {\n        message: `Databricks app status: ${appData.status || 'DEPLOYING'}`,\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n      };\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    // App might not exist yet or CLI error\n    logger.error('Error checking Databricks app status', { error, appName });\n    return {\n      message: 'Checking Databricks app status...',\n      isDeployed: false,\n      type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.

The issue isn't that Databricks CLI commands need to run in the background - it's that frontend polling is disabled for Databricks, so users don't get real-time feedback during deployment.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Koyeb Pattern (Works Correctly)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Koyeb API calls complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: For polling Koyeb infrastructure readiness  \n- **Frontend polls**: Real-time status updates until infrastructure is `HEALTHY`\n- **User experience**: Immediate response + real-time updates\n\n### Databricks Pattern (Broken)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Databricks CLI commands complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: `databricks-${appId}` format\n- **Frontend polling**: **DISABLED** (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- **User experience**: No response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n\n### The Real Problem\nFrontend polling is explicitly disabled for Databricks:\n```typescript\n// useDeploymentStatus.ts:57\nenabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb')\n```\n\n## Desired End State\n\nSame experience as Koyeb:\n1. **Databricks deployment completes** (CLI commands finish)\n2. **User gets immediate response** with deployment ID  \n3. **Frontend polls** actual Databricks app status\n4. **Real-time updates** until app is verified as running\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Frontend builds: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] Backend compiles: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status polls and updates in real-time  \n- [ ] Status correctly shows when Databricks app is ready\n- [ ] Error handling works for failed deployments\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work correctly\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding background job systems or queues\n- Not modifying database schema\n- Not changing agent message generation logic\n- Not creating new deployment infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nFollow the exact Koyeb pattern:\n1. **Enable polling**: Remove Databricks restriction in frontend hooks\n2. **Poll real status**: Check actual Databricks app readiness (not just database)\n3. **Status mapping**: Map Databricks app states to standard deployment states\n\n## Phase 1: Enable Frontend Polling\n\n### Overview\nRemove the restriction that disables polling for Databricks deployments, enabling the same real-time experience as Koyeb.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

The issue isn't that Databricks CLI commands need to run in the background - it's that frontend polling is disabled for Databricks, so users don't get real-time feedback during deployment.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Koyeb Pattern (Works Correctly)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Koyeb API calls complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: For polling Koyeb infrastructure readiness  \n- **Frontend polls**: Real-time status updates until infrastructure is `HEALTHY`\n- **User experience**: Immediate response + real-time updates\n\n### Databricks Pattern (Broken)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Databricks CLI commands complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: `databricks-${appId}` format\n- **Frontend polling**: **DISABLED** (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- **User experience**: No response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n\n### The Real Problem\nFrontend polling is explicitly disabled for Databricks:\n```typescript\n// useDeploymentStatus.ts:57\nenabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb')\n```\n\n## Desired End State\n\nSame experience as Koyeb:\n1. **Databricks deployment completes** (CLI commands finish)\n2. **User gets immediate response** with deployment ID  \n3. **Frontend polls** actual Databricks app status\n4. **Real-time updates** until app is verified as running\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Frontend builds: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] Backend compiles: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status polls and updates in real-time  \n- [ ] Status correctly shows when Databricks app is ready\n- [ ] Error handling works for failed deployments\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work correctly\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding background job systems or queues\n- Not modifying database schema\n- Not changing agent message generation logic\n- Not creating new deployment infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nFollow the exact Koyeb pattern:\n1. **Enable polling**: Remove Databricks restriction in frontend hooks\n2. **Poll real status**: Check actual Databricks app readiness (not just database)\n3. **Status mapping**: Map Databricks app states to standard deployment states\n\n## Phase 1: Enable Frontend Polling\n\n### Overview\nRemove the restriction that disables polling for Databricks deployments, enabling the same real-time experience as Koyeb.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Enable Databricks Polling\n**File**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts`\n**Changes**: Remove deployment type restriction\n\n```typescript\n// Modify enabled condition around line 53-58\nenabled: Boolean(\n  deploymentId && \n  options?.enabled !== false\n  // REMOVED: && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb'\n  // Now enables polling for both Koyeb and Databricks\n),\n```\n\n#### 2.

The issue isn't that Databricks CLI commands need to run in the background - it's that frontend polling is disabled for Databricks, so users don't get real-time feedback during deployment.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Koyeb Pattern (Works Correctly)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Koyeb API calls complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: For polling Koyeb infrastructure readiness  \n- **Frontend polls**: Real-time status updates until infrastructure is `HEALTHY`\n- **User experience**: Immediate response + real-time updates\n\n### Databricks Pattern (Broken)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Databricks CLI commands complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: `databricks-${appId}` format\n- **Frontend polling**: **DISABLED** (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- **User experience**: No response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n\n### The Real Problem\nFrontend polling is explicitly disabled for Databricks:\n```typescript\n// useDeploymentStatus.ts:57\nenabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb')\n```\n\n## Desired End State\n\nSame experience as Koyeb:\n1. **Databricks deployment completes** (CLI commands finish)\n2. **User gets immediate response** with deployment ID  \n3. **Frontend polls** actual Databricks app status\n4. **Real-time updates** until app is verified as running\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Frontend builds: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] Backend compiles: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status polls and updates in real-time  \n- [ ] Status correctly shows when Databricks app is ready\n- [ ] Error handling works for failed deployments\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work correctly\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding background job systems or queues\n- Not modifying database schema\n- Not changing agent message generation logic\n- Not creating new deployment infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nFollow the exact Koyeb pattern:\n1. **Enable polling**: Remove Databricks restriction in frontend hooks\n2. **Poll real status**: Check actual Databricks app readiness (not just database)\n3. **Status mapping**: Map Databricks app states to standard deployment states\n\n## Phase 1: Enable Frontend Polling\n\n### Overview\nRemove the restriction that disables polling for Databricks deployments, enabling the same real-time experience as Koyeb.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Enable Databricks Polling\n**File**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts`\n**Changes**: Remove deployment type restriction\n\n```typescript\n// Modify enabled condition around line 53-58\nenabled: Boolean(\n  deploymentId && \n  options?.enabled !== false\n  // REMOVED: && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb'\n  // Now enables polling for both Koyeb and Databricks\n),\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Deployment State Logic\n**File**: `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/utils.ts`  \n**Changes**: Allow normal polling logic for Databricks\n\n```typescript\n// Modify getDeploymentType function around line 31-35\nfunction getDeploymentType(\n  originalType: PlatformMessageType | undefined,\n  deploymentStatus: DeploymentStatusData,\n  hasPollingError: boolean,\n  deploymentType?: 'databricks' | 'koyeb',\n): PlatformMessageType {\n  // Remove special Databricks handling - let normal polling work\n  // if (deploymentType === 'databricks' && originalType === PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS) {\n  //   return originalType;\n  // }\n\n  if (hasPollingError) {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n  }\n\n  if (deploymentStatus?.type === 'HEALTHY') {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE;\n  }\n\n  if (deploymentStatus?.type === 'ERROR') {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n  }\n\n  return originalType || PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS;\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Frontend builds successfully: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `cd apps/web && bun types:check`\n- [ ] No runtime errors in polling hook\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Databricks deployments start polling immediately\n- [ ] Polling requests hit `/deployment-status/databricks-{appId}` endpoint\n- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Databricks App Status Polling\n\n### Overview\nInstead of just checking database status, poll the actual Databricks app to verify it's running and accessible, matching the Koyeb infrastructure readiness pattern.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Add Databricks Status Checker\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts`\n**Changes**: Add function to check actual Databricks app status\n\n```typescript\nimport { exec as execNative } from 'node:child_process';\nimport { promisify } from 'node:util';\n\nconst exec = promisify(execNative);\n\nexport async function getDatabricksAppStatus({\n  appName,\n  databricksApiKey,\n  databricksHost,\n}: {\n  appName: string;\n  databricksApiKey: string;\n  databricksHost: string;\n}): Promise<{\n  message: string;\n  isDeployed: boolean;\n  type: 'HEALTHY' | 'ERROR' | 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS';\n}> {\n  const databricksEnv = {\n    ...process.env,\n    DATABRICKS_TOKEN: databricksApiKey,\n    DATABRICKS_HOST: databricksHost,\n  };\n\n  try {\n    // Check if app exists and get its status\n    const result = await exec(\n      `databricks apps get ${appName} --output json`,\n      { env: databricksEnv }\n    );\n\n    const appData = JSON.parse(result.stdout);\n    \n    // Check app status - similar to how Koyeb checks deployment health\n    if (appData.status === 'RUNNING' && appData.url) {\n      return {\n        message: 'Databricks app is running and accessible',\n        isDeployed: true,\n        type: 'HEALTHY',\n      };\n    } else if (appData.status === 'FAILED' || appData.status === 'STOPPED') {\n      return {\n        message: `Databricks app status: ${appData.status}`,\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'ERROR',\n      };\n    } else {\n      // Starting, deploying, etc.\n      return {\n        message: `Databricks app status: ${appData.status || 'DEPLOYING'}`,\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n      };\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    // App might not exist yet or CLI error\n    logger.error('Error checking Databricks app status', { error, appName });\n    return {\n      message: 'Checking Databricks app status...',\n      isDeployed: false,\n      type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Generic Deployment Status\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/generic-deployment-status.ts`\n**Changes**: Use real Databricks app status instead of just database\n\n```typescript\n// Add import\nimport { getDatabricksAppStatus } from './databricks';\n\n// Modify handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus function around line 51-110\nasync function handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus(\n  deploymentId: string,\n  messageId: string | undefined,\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  try {\n    const appId = deploymentId.replace('databricks-', '');\n    \n    // Get app info from database\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        deployStatus: apps.deployStatus,\n        appUrl: apps.appUrl,\n        appName: apps.appName,\n        databricksApiKey: apps.databricksApiKey,\n        databricksHost: apps.databricksHost,\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(and(eq(apps.id, appId), eq(apps.ownerId, request.user.id!)))\n      .limit(1);\n\n    if (!app[0]) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({ message: 'App not found' });\n    }\n\n    const { deployStatus, appName, databricksApiKey, databricksHost } = app[0];\n    \n    // If deployment hasn't started yet, show pending\n    if (deployStatus === DeployStatus.PENDING) {\n      const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n        message: 'Databricks deployment pending...',\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n        deploymentType: 'databricks',\n      };\n      return reply.send(response);\n    }\n\n    // If deployment failed during CLI commands, show error\n    if (deployStatus === DeployStatus.FAILED) {\n      const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n        message: 'Databricks deployment failed',\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'ERROR',\n        deploymentType: 'databricks',\n      };\n      return reply.send(response);\n    }\n\n    // If deployment completed, check actual app status (like Koyeb infrastructure check)\n    if (deployStatus === DeployStatus.DEPLOYED && appName && databricksApiKey && databricksHost) {\n      const appStatus = await getDatabricksAppStatus({\n        appName,\n        databricksApiKey,\n        databricksHost,\n      });\n\n      const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n        message: appStatus.message,\n        isDeployed: appStatus.isDeployed,\n        type: appStatus.type,\n        deploymentType: 'databricks',\n      };\n\n      // Update message if deployment reached final state\n      if (\n        messageId &&\n        (response.type === 'HEALTHY' || response.type === 'ERROR')\n      ) {\n        await updateDeploymentMessage(messageId, response.type, response.message);\n      }\n\n      return reply.send(response);\n    }\n\n    // Default case - deployment in progress\n    const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n      message: 'Databricks deployment in progress...',\n      isDeployed: false,\n      type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n      deploymentType: 'databricks',\n    };\n\n    return reply.send(response);\n  } catch (error) {\n    logger.error('Error getting Databricks deployment status', { error });\n    return reply.status(500).send({ message: 'Internal server error' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Function compiles and imports correctly: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n- [ ] Status endpoint returns proper JSON: `curl /deployment-status/databricks-test123`\n- [ ] Database queries execute without errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Status endpoint returns real Databricks app status\n- [ ] Status correctly detects when app is RUNNING vs DEPLOYING\n- [ ] Error states are handled properly (app failures, CLI errors)\n- [ ] Message updates work when app becomes HEALTHY or ERROR\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Enhanced UI Messaging\n\n### Overview\nUpdate deployment messages to provide appropriate feedback for Databricks deployments during real-time polling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Progress Indicator Enhancement\n**File**: `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/deployment-message.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update progress message for Databricks\n\n```typescript\n// Modify ProgressIndicator component around line 92-95\n<span className=\"text-xs text-muted-foreground\">\n  {deploymentType === 'databricks' \n    ? 'Deploying to Databricks workspace and starting app...' \n    : 'This may take up some minutes...'}\n</span>\n```\n\n#### 2. Export Databricks Status Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export new status function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deployApp } from './deploy-app';\nexport { getKoyebDeploymentEndpoint } from './koyeb';\nexport { getGenericDeploymentEndpoint } from './generic-deployment-status';\nexport { getDatabricksAppStatus } from './databricks';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Frontend builds successfully: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] Export statements resolve: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n- [ ] Component renders without errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Progress indicator shows appropriate message for Databricks\n- [ ] UI updates correctly during deployment phases\n- [ ] Final success/error states display properly\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- **getDatabricksAppStatus**: Status parsing for different Databricks app states\n- **handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus**: Response formatting and database queries\n- **Frontend hooks**: Polling enablement and state transitions\n- **Deployment utils**: Status mapping and error handling\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- **End-to-end polling**: Message → deployment complete → frontend polling → real status\n- **Concurrent deployments**: Multiple Databricks deployments polling simultaneously\n- **Error scenarios**: Failed deployments, CLI timeouts, invalid credentials\n- **Status accuracy**: Verify polling returns actual Databricks app states\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. **Start Databricks deployment** - verify user gets immediate response with deployment ID\n2. **Monitor frontend polling** - check real-time status updates in UI during deployment\n3. **Verify status accuracy** - ensure polling shows actual Databricks app readiness\n4. **Test error handling** - trigger deployment failures and verify error states\n5. **Concurrent deployments** - start multiple deployments and verify independent polling\n6. **Status endpoint** - manually test `/deployment-status/databricks-{appId}` responses\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Polling Frequency:\n- Uses existing 5-second polling interval (same as Koyeb)\n- Stops polling when app reaches HEALTHY or ERROR state\n- Minimal additional CLI overhead (single `databricks apps get` command)\n\n### CLI Command Impact:\n- Status check uses lightweight `databricks apps get` (< 1 second)\n- No impact on deployment CLI commands (they remain unchanged)\n- Error handling prevents infinite polling on CLI failures\n\n### Concurrent Deployments:\n- Each deployment polls independently\n- Database queries isolated by user and app ID\n- No shared state between polling sessions\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n### Rollout Strategy:\n- **Phase-by-phase deployment** - each phase is independent\n- **Backward compatible** - existing Databricks deployments continue working\n- **Feature toggle ready** - polling can be disabled if needed\n\n### No Breaking Changes:\n- Databricks deployment logic unchanged\n- Database schema unchanged (no migrations needed)\n- API endpoints maintain same response format\n- Frontend components work with both polling enabled/disabled\n\n### Configuration:\n- No new environment variables required\n- Uses existing Databricks API credentials from app table\n- Leverages existing polling infrastructure and timeouts\n\n## References\n\n- Koyeb async pattern: `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:604-624`\n- Current Databricks deployment: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts:22-206`\n- Frontend polling hook: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:25-84`\n- Generic deployment status: `apps/backend/src/deploy/generic-deployment-status.ts:45-185`\n- Deployment state utilities: `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/utils.ts`\n- **End-to-end deployment**: Message → async deployment → status polling → completion\n- **Concurrent deployments**: Multiple Databricks deployments running simultaneously\n- **Error scenarios**: Failed deployments, timeouts, invalid configurations\n- **Status persistence**: Job status survives server restarts (within memory limits)\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. **Start Databricks deployment** -

Here's the **much simpler approach**:\n\n## ✅ Simplified Plan: Follow Koyeb Pattern Exactly\n\nThe new plan is **3 phases instead of 5**, with **no background job manager complexity**:\n\n### **The Key Insight**\nThe problem isn't that Databricks CLI needs to run in background - it's that **frontend polling is explicitly disabled** for Databricks:\n\n```typescript\n// Current code disables polling for Databricks\nenabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb')\n```\n\n### **Simple Solution**\n1. **Phase 1**: Remove the frontend polling restriction (2 line changes)\n2. **Phase 2**: Add real Databricks app status checking (like Koyeb infrastructure polling)  \n3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced UI messaging\n\n### **Same Pattern as Koyeb**\n- **Synchronous deployment**: CLI commands run to completion\n- **Return deployment ID**: `databricks-${appId}` \n- **Frontend polls**: Real-time status of actual Databricks app\n- **User experience**: Immediate response + real-time updates\n\n### **Key Benefits**\n✅ **No complex job system** - uses existing infrastructure  \n✅ **3 phases instead of 5** - much simpler implementation  \n✅ **Follows proven pattern** - exactly like Koyeb works  \n✅ **Minimal changes** - mostly enabling existing polling + adding status check  \n\nThe plan now mirrors Koyeb exactly: deployment completes synchronously, returns immediately with ID, frontend polls the actual infrastructure readiness (Databricks app status vs Koyeb service health).\n\nDoes this simplified approach look much better?

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n\nDon't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n\nARGUMENTS: /Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/thoughts/shared/plans/databricks-async-deployment.md"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"acd0aea3-29bd-4215-a675-303d330d8dfe","timestamp":"2025-08-29T13:45:37.473Z"}

The issue isn't that Databricks CLI commands need to run in the background - it's that frontend polling is disabled for Databricks, so users don't get real-time feedback during deployment.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Koyeb Pattern (Works Correctly)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Koyeb API calls complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: For polling Koyeb infrastructure readiness  \n- **Frontend polls**: Real-time status updates until infrastructure is `HEALTHY`\n- **User experience**: Immediate response + real-time updates\n\n### Databricks Pattern (Broken)\n- **Synchronous deployment**: All Databricks CLI commands complete, database set to `DEPLOYED`\n- **Returns deployment ID**: `databricks-${appId}` format\n- **Frontend polling**: **DISABLED** (`useDeploymentStatus.ts:57`)\n- **User experience**: No response until deployment completes (2-5+ minutes)\n\n### The Real Problem\nFrontend polling is explicitly disabled for Databricks:\n```typescript\n// useDeploymentStatus.ts:57\nenabled: Boolean(deploymentId && options?.enabled !== false && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb')\n```\n\n## Desired End State\n\nSame experience as Koyeb:\n1. **Databricks deployment completes** (CLI commands finish)\n2. **User gets immediate response** with deployment ID  \n3. **Frontend polls** actual Databricks app status\n4. **Real-time updates** until app is verified as running\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Frontend builds: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] Backend compiles: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] User gets immediate response when Databricks deployment starts\n- [ ] Deployment status polls and updates in real-time  \n- [ ] Status correctly shows when Databricks app is ready\n- [ ] Error handling works for failed deployments\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent deployments work correctly\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not changing Databricks CLI commands or deployment logic\n- Not adding background job systems or queues\n- Not modifying database schema\n- Not changing agent message generation logic\n- Not creating new deployment infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nFollow the exact Koyeb pattern:\n1. **Enable polling**: Remove Databricks restriction in frontend hooks\n2. **Poll real status**: Check actual Databricks app readiness (not just database)\n3. **Status mapping**: Map Databricks app states to standard deployment states\n\n## Phase 1: Enable Frontend Polling\n\n### Overview\nRemove the restriction that disables polling for Databricks deployments, enabling the same real-time experience as Koyeb.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Enable Databricks Polling\n**File**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts`\n**Changes**: Remove deployment type restriction\n\n```typescript\n// Modify enabled condition around line 53-58\nenabled: Boolean(\n  deploymentId && \n  options?.enabled !== false\n  // REMOVED: && options?.deploymentType === 'koyeb'\n  // Now enables polling for both Koyeb and Databricks\n),\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Deployment State Logic\n**File**: `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/utils.ts`  \n**Changes**: Allow normal polling logic for Databricks\n\n```typescript\n// Modify getDeploymentType function around line 31-35\nfunction getDeploymentType(\n  originalType: PlatformMessageType | undefined,\n  deploymentStatus: DeploymentStatusData,\n  hasPollingError: boolean,\n  deploymentType?: 'databricks' | 'koyeb',\n): PlatformMessageType {\n  // Remove special Databricks handling - let normal polling work\n  // if (deploymentType === 'databricks' && originalType === PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS) {\n  //   return originalType;\n  // }\n\n  if (hasPollingError) {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n  }\n\n  if (deploymentStatus?.type === 'HEALTHY') {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE;\n  }\n\n  if (deploymentStatus?.type === 'ERROR') {\n    return PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_FAILED;\n  }\n\n  return originalType || PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS;\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Frontend builds successfully: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `cd apps/web && bun types:check`\n- [ ] No runtime errors in polling hook\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Databricks deployments start polling immediately\n- [ ] Polling requests hit `/deployment-status/databricks-{appId}` endpoint\n- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Databricks App Status Polling\n\n### Overview\nInstead of just checking database status, poll the actual Databricks app to verify it's running and accessible, matching the Koyeb infrastructure readiness pattern.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Add Databricks Status Checker\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts`\n**Changes**: Add function to check actual Databricks app status\n\n```typescript\nimport { exec as execNative } from 'node:child_process';\nimport { promisify } from 'node:util';\n\nconst exec = promisify(execNative);\n\nexport async function getDatabricksAppStatus({\n  appName,\n  databricksApiKey,\n  databricksHost,\n}: {\n  appName: string;\n  databricksApiKey: string;\n  databricksHost: string;\n}): Promise<{\n  message: string;\n  isDeployed: boolean;\n  type: 'HEALTHY' | 'ERROR' | 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS';\n}> {\n  const databricksEnv = {\n    ...process.env,\n    DATABRICKS_TOKEN: databricksApiKey,\n    DATABRICKS_HOST: databricksHost,\n  };\n\n  try {\n    // Check if app exists and get its status\n    const result = await exec(\n      `databricks apps get ${appName} --output json`,\n      { env: databricksEnv }\n    );\n\n    const appData = JSON.parse(result.stdout);\n    \n    // Check app status - similar to how Koyeb checks deployment health\n    if (appData.status === 'RUNNING' && appData.url) {\n      return {\n        message: 'Databricks app is running and accessible',\n        isDeployed: true,\n        type: 'HEALTHY',\n      };\n    } else if (appData.status === 'FAILED' || appData.status === 'STOPPED') {\n      return {\n        message: `Databricks app status: ${appData.status}`,\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'ERROR',\n      };\n    } else {\n      // Starting, deploying, etc.\n      return {\n        message: `Databricks app status: ${appData.status || 'DEPLOYING'}`,\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n      };\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    // App might not exist yet or CLI error\n    logger.error('Error checking Databricks app status', { error, appName });\n    return {\n      message: 'Checking Databricks app status...',\n      isDeployed: false,\n      type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Generic Deployment Status\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/generic-deployment-status.ts`\n**Changes**: Use real Databricks app status instead of just database\n\n```typescript\n// Add import\nimport { getDatabricksAppStatus } from './databricks';\n\n// Modify handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus function around line 51-110\nasync function handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus(\n  deploymentId: string,\n  messageId: string | undefined,\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  try {\n    const appId = deploymentId.replace('databricks-', '');\n    \n    // Get app info from database\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        deployStatus: apps.deployStatus,\n        appUrl: apps.appUrl,\n        appName: apps.appName,\n        databricksApiKey: apps.databricksApiKey,\n        databricksHost: apps.databricksHost,\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(and(eq(apps.id, appId), eq(apps.ownerId, request.user.id!)))\n      .limit(1);\n\n    if (!app[0]) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({ message: 'App not found' });\n    }\n\n    const { deployStatus, appName, databricksApiKey, databricksHost } = app[0];\n    \n    // If deployment hasn't started yet, show pending\n    if (deployStatus === DeployStatus.PENDING) {\n      const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n        message: 'Databricks deployment pending...',\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n        deploymentType: 'databricks',\n      };\n      return reply.send(response);\n    }\n\n    // If deployment failed during CLI commands, show error\n    if (deployStatus === DeployStatus.FAILED) {\n      const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n        message: 'Databricks deployment failed',\n        isDeployed: false,\n        type: 'ERROR',\n        deploymentType: 'databricks',\n      };\n      return reply.send(response);\n    }\n\n    // If deployment completed, check actual app status (like Koyeb infrastructure check)\n    if (deployStatus === DeployStatus.DEPLOYED && appName && databricksApiKey && databricksHost) {\n      const appStatus = await getDatabricksAppStatus({\n        appName,\n        databricksApiKey,\n        databricksHost,\n      });\n\n      const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n        message: appStatus.message,\n        isDeployed: appStatus.isDeployed,\n        type: appStatus.type,\n        deploymentType: 'databricks',\n      };\n\n      // Update message if deployment reached final state\n      if (\n        messageId &&\n        (response.type === 'HEALTHY' || response.type === 'ERROR')\n      ) {\n        await updateDeploymentMessage(messageId, response.type, response.message);\n      }\n\n      return reply.send(response);\n    }\n\n    // Default case - deployment in progress\n    const response: DeploymentStatusResponse = {\n      message: 'Databricks deployment in progress...',\n      isDeployed: false,\n      type: 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS',\n      deploymentType: 'databricks',\n    };\n\n    return reply.send(response);\n  } catch (error) {\n    logger.error('Error getting Databricks deployment status', { error });\n    return reply.status(500).send({ message: 'Internal server error' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Function compiles and imports correctly: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n- [ ] Status endpoint returns proper JSON: `curl /deployment-status/databricks-test123`\n- [ ] Database queries execute without errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Status endpoint returns real Databricks app status\n- [ ] Status correctly detects when app is RUNNING vs DEPLOYING\n- [ ] Error states are handled properly (app failures, CLI errors)\n- [ ] Message updates work when app becomes HEALTHY or ERROR\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Enhanced UI Messaging\n\n### Overview\nUpdate deployment messages to provide appropriate feedback for Databricks deployments during real-time polling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Progress Indicator Enhancement\n**File**: `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/deployment-message.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update progress message for Databricks\n\n```typescript\n// Modify ProgressIndicator component around line 92-95\n<span className=\"text-xs text-muted-foreground\">\n  {deploymentType === 'databricks' \n    ? 'Deploying to Databricks workspace and starting app...' \n    : 'This may take up some minutes...'}\n</span>\n```\n\n#### 2. Export Databricks Status Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/deploy/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export new status function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deployApp } from './deploy-app';\nexport { getKoyebDeploymentEndpoint } from './koyeb';\nexport { getGenericDeploymentEndpoint } from './generic-deployment-status';\nexport { getDatabricksAppStatus } from './databricks';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Frontend builds successfully: `cd apps/web && bun build`\n- [ ] Export statements resolve: `cd apps/backend && bun types:check`\n- [ ] Component renders without errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Progress indicator shows appropriate message for Databricks\n- [ ] UI updates correctly during deployment phases\n- [ ] Final success/error states display properly\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- **getDatabricksAppStatus**: Status parsing for different Databricks app states\n- **handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus**: Response formatting and database queries\n- **Frontend hooks**: Polling enablement and state transitions\n- **Deployment utils**: Status mapping and error handling\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- **End-to-end polling**: Message → deployment complete → frontend polling → real status\n- **Concurrent deployments**: Multiple Databricks deployments polling simultaneously\n- **Error scenarios**: Failed deployments, CLI timeouts, invalid credentials\n- **Status accuracy**: Verify polling returns actual Databricks app states\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. **Start Databricks deployment** - verify user gets immediate response with deployment ID\n2. **Monitor frontend polling** - check real-time status updates in UI during deployment\n3. **Verify status accuracy** - ensure polling shows actual Databricks app readiness\n4. **Test error handling** - trigger deployment failures and verify error states\n5. **Concurrent deployments** - start multiple deployments and verify independent polling\n6. **Status endpoint** - manually test `/deployment-status/databricks-{appId}` responses\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Polling Frequency:\n- Uses existing 5-second polling interval (same as Koyeb)\n- Stops polling when app reaches HEALTHY or ERROR state\n- Minimal additional CLI overhead (single `databricks apps get` command)\n\n### CLI Command Impact:\n- Status check uses lightweight `databricks apps get` (< 1 second)\n- No impact on deployment CLI commands (they remain unchanged)\n- Error handling prevents infinite polling on CLI failures\n\n### Concurrent Deployments:\n- Each deployment polls independently\n- Database queries isolated by user and app ID\n- No shared state between polling sessions\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n### Rollout Strategy:\n- **Phase-by-phase deployment** - each phase is independent\n- **Backward compatible** - existing Databricks deployments continue working\n- **Feature toggle ready** - polling can be disabled if needed\n\n### No Breaking Changes:\n- Databricks deployment logic unchanged\n- Database schema unchanged (no migrations needed)\n- API endpoints maintain same response format\n- Frontend components work with both polling enabled/disabled\n\n### Configuration:\n- No new environment variables required\n- Uses existing Databricks API credentials from app table\n- Leverages existing polling infrastructure and timeouts\n\n## References\n\n- Koyeb async pattern: `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:604-624`\n- Current Databricks deployment: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts:22-206`\n- Frontend polling hook: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:25-84`\n- Generic deployment status: `apps/backend/src/deploy/generic-deployment-status.ts:45-185`\n- Deployment state utilities: `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/utils.ts`\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. **Start Databricks deployment** - verify user gets immediate response\n2. **Monitor status endpoint** - check real-time status updates during deployment  \n3. **Verify UI polling** - confirm frontend shows deployment progress\n4. **Test error handling** - trigger deployment failures and verify error reporting\n5. **Concurrent deployments** - start multiple deployments simultaneously\n6. **Health monitoring** - check `/health` endpoint shows job metrics\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Memory Management:\n- Background job manager uses in-memory storage (jobs cleaned up after 1 hour)\n- Job data size limited by deployment parameters (file paths, not file contents)\n- Automatic cleanup prevents unbounded memory growth\n\n### Concurrency:\n- Background jobs process sequentially (avoid resource conflicts)\n- Each deployment runs in isolated async context\n- Database connections pooled to handle concurrent status queries\n\n### Monitoring:\n- Job metrics available via health endpoint\n- Comprehensive logging for job lifecycle events\n- Error tracking with structured logging\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n### Rollout Strategy:\n1. **Phase-by-phase deployment** - each phase can be deployed independently\n2. **Feature flag ready** - can disable async behavior if issues arise\n3. **Backward compatibility** - existing deployments continue to work\n\n### Database Changes:\n- No schema migrations required (uses existing `apps.deployStatus`)\n- Background job storage is in-memory only\n- Status tracking uses existing patterns\n\n### Configuration:\n- No new environment variables required\n- Uses existing Databricks API credentials from request\n- Leverages existing timeout configurations\n\n## References\n\n- Current synchronous implementation: `apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts:22-206`\n- Message queue patterns: `apps/backend/src/apps/message-queue.ts`\n- Koyeb async pattern: `apps/backend/src/deploy/koyeb.ts:604-624`\n- Frontend polling infrastructure: `apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts:25-84`\n- Database schema: `apps/backend/src/db/schema.ts:28`","numLines":486,"startLine":1,"totalLines":486}}}

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation to ensure I capture all details:\n\n1. Initial request: User wanted to show deployment messages for Databricks apps, noting that the current system uses polling for Koyeb but doesn't do anything for Databricks. Key issue: Databricks is handled synchronously while Koyeb is handled asynchronously.\n\n2. My initial work (before plan mode):\n   - Researched the deployment system extensively\n   - Fixed deployment message system by adding deployment type awareness\n   - Made changes to enable deployment type detection\n   - Key files modified: useDeploymentStatus.ts, deployment-message.tsx, utils.ts, generic-deployment-status.ts\n\n3. User then requested changing Databricks deployment to be async so it doesn't block generation, wanting the same polling pattern as Koyeb.\n\n4. I created an initial complex plan with background job manager, which was overly complicated.\n\n5. Critical user feedback: \"why do we need a background manager? Can we do the same we were doing in koyeb instead?\" - This was pivotal feedback that changed the approach.\n\n6. I researched more deeply and discovered Koyeb doesn't actually use background jobs - it completes synchronously but polls for infrastructure readiness.\n\n7. User approved the simplified approach: \"yes, change the plan\"\n\n8. I revised the plan to a much simpler 3-phase approach following Koyeb's exact pattern.\n\n9. User then asked me to implement the plan, providing the path to the implementation plan.\n\n10. I began implementing the plan:\n    - Phase 1: Successfully removed frontend polling restrictions\n    - Phase 2.1: Added getDatabricksAppStatus function to databricks.ts\n    - Phase 2.2: Updated generic-deployment-status.ts to use real Databricks app status\n    - Was in the middle of Phase 2, about to complete it and move to Phase 3\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Initial: Fix deployment message display for Databricks apps, noting that it currently uses Koyeb polling pattern but doesn't work for Databricks deployments\n   - Evolution: Change Databricks deployment to be async so it doesn't block generation, using the same polling pattern as Koyeb\n   - Critical refinement after user feedback: Use the exact same pattern as Koyeb (no background job manager), just enable polling for Databricks deployments\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Deployment polling patterns (sync vs async)\n   - Koyeb deployment: Synchronous API calls + async infrastructure readiness polling\n   - Databricks deployment: Currently fully synchronous, blocks message generation for 2-5+ minutes\n   - Frontend polling using React Query with 5-second intervals\n   - Deployment status states: PENDING → DEPLOYING → DEPLOYED/FAILED\n   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates\n   - Deployment ID formats: `databricks-${appId}` vs Koyeb deployment IDs\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/web/src/hooks/useDeploymentStatus.ts`\n      - Critical file that controls frontend polling behavior\n      - Modified to remove Databricks restriction\n      ```typescript\n      enabled: Boolean(\n        deploymentId && \n        options?.enabled !== false\n        // Now enables polling for both Koyeb and Databricks deployments\n      ),\n      ```\n   \n   - `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/utils.ts`\n      - Handles deployment state logic for UI\n      - Removed special Databricks handling to allow normal polling\n      ```typescript\n      // Remove special Databricks handling - let normal polling work for both deployment types\n      // if (deploymentType === 'databricks' && originalType === PlatformMessageType.DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS) {\n      //   return originalType;\n      // }\n      ```\n   \n   - `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/deploy/databricks.ts`\n      - Added new function to check actual Databricks app status\n      ```typescript\n      export async function getDatabricksAppStatus({\n        appName,\n        databricksApiKey,\n        databricksHost,\n      }: {\n        appName: string;\n        databricksApiKey: string;\n        databricksHost: string;\n      }): Promise<{\n        message: string;\n        isDeployed: boolean;\n        type: 'HEALTHY' | 'ERROR' | 'DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS';\n      }>\n      ```\n   \n   - `/Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/apps/backend/src/deploy/generic-deployment-status.ts`\n      - Updated to use real Databricks app status instead of just database status\n      - Added import for getDatabricksAppStatus\n      - Modified handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus to poll actual app status like Koyeb does\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - Initial directory navigation error: \"no such file or directory: apps/web\"\n     - Fixed by using correct path structure from root\n   - No other errors encountered during implementation\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Solved: Identified that frontend polling was explicitly disabled for Databricks\n   - Solved: Discovered Koyeb pattern doesn't use background jobs, just polls infrastructure readiness\n   - Solved: Simplified implementation from complex 5-phase plan with background job manager to simple 3-phase plan\n   - Ongoing: Implementing the simplified plan to enable Databricks polling\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"I want to show a deployment message to databricks apps deployment for the web. However, as it stands, it uses polling to get Koyeb deployment and doesnt even do anything with Databricks apps. There is a big difference betweem databricks apps and koyeb. One is currently being handled as sync and the other is being handled as async deployments.\"\n   - \"I want to change the databricks deployment status to be async, so it doesnt block generation. So we will need to poll the status the same way we are doing with koyeb.\"\n   - \"why do we need a background manager? Can we do the same we were doing in koyeb instead?\"\n   - \"yes, change the plan\"\n   - \"/implement-plan /Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/thoughts/shared/plans/databricks-async-deployment.md\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Complete Phase 2.2: Verify generic deployment status is working correctly\n   - Phase 3.1: Update progress indicator for Databricks deployments\n   - Phase 3.2: Export getDatabricksAppStatus function\n   - Run all automated verification tests\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Just completed updating the `handleDatabricksDeploymentStatus` function in `generic-deployment-status.ts` to use real Databricks app status polling instead of just database status. This implements the same pattern as Koyeb - when deployment is DEPLOYED in database, it polls the actual Databricks app status to check if it's RUNNING. The function now:\n   - Gets app info including appName, databricksApiKey, and databricksHost from database\n   - Calls getDatabricksAppStatus() to check actual app status when deployStatus is DEPLOYED\n   - Returns appropriate status based on real app state (HEALTHY, ERROR, or DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS)\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Continue with Phase 3: Enhanced UI Messaging, specifically updating the progress indicator component to show appropriate messages for Databricks deployments. As shown in the implementation plan: \"Phase 3.1: Update progress indicator for Databricks deployments\" in `apps/web/src/components/chat/messages/platform-message/deployment-message.tsx`. This is directly in line with completing the implementation plan the user asked me to execute..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."},"isVisibleInTranscriptOnly":true,"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"b2f37d9f-77b1-4180-af36-bcc65949acae","timestamp":"2025-08-29T13:50:08.277Z"}

This will involve adding an export statement to ensure the function can be imported and used in other parts of the backend codebase.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":22322,"cache_read_input_tokens":37624,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":22322,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSc7FMVHHEG4k9Ga9bBm3","type":"assistant","uuid":"c42c672b-e96d-4207-82c7-c86ba4ba03e3","timestamp":"2025-08-29T13:50:25.197Z"}

Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe implementation has been completed successfully following the 3-phase plan:\n\n### ✅ Phase 1: Enable frontend polling for Databricks deployments\n- **1.1**: Removed deployment type restriction in `useDeploymentStatus.ts` - enabling polling for both Koyeb and Databricks\n- **1.2**: Updated deployment state logic in `utils.ts` - allowing normal polling behavior for Databricks\n\n### ✅ Phase 2: Add Databricks app status polling to backend  \n- **2.1**: Added `getDatabricksAppStatus` function to `databricks.ts` - checks actual app status via CLI\n- **2.2**: Updated generic deployment status to use real Databricks app status - polls actual infrastructure readiness like Koyeb\n\n### ✅ Phase 3: Enhanced UI messaging for Databricks\n- **3.1**: Updated progress indicator to show \"Deploying to Databricks workspace and starting app...\" for Databricks deployments\n- **3.2**: Exported `getDatabricksAppStatus` function for proper module access\n\n### ✅ All automated verification tests passed:\n- TypeScript type checking: ✅ PASSED\n- Linting: ✅ PASSED  \n- Frontend build: ✅ PASSED\n- Backend compilation: ✅ PASSED\n\nThe implementation successfully enables real-time polling for Databricks deployments using the exact same pattern as Koyeb, providing users with immediate feedback and progress updates during deployment.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":638,"cache_read_input_tokens":92925,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":638,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSc7WcnSua5UvgVAnw7Ek","type":"assistant","uuid":"30ada10d-090e-4a4d-b9ea-c2176d13ec44","timestamp":"2025-08-29T13:53:49.230Z"}
