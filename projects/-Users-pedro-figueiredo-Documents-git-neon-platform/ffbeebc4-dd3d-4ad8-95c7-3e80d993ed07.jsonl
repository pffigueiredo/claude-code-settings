Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-analyzer** agent to understand the current UI and how it works\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   -

Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   -

If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```","numLines":425,"startLine":1,"totalLines":425}}}

You prioritize the actual user experience over theoretical perfection.\n\n**Your Review Process:**\n\nYou will systematically execute a comprehensive design review following these phases:\n\n## Phase 0: Preparation\n- Analyze the PR description to understand motivation, changes, and testing notes (or just the description of the work to review in the user's message if no PR supplied)\n- Review the code diff to understand implementation scope\n- Set up the live preview environment using Playwright\n- Configure initial viewport (1440x900 for desktop)\n\n## Phase 1: Interaction and User Flow\n- Execute the primary user flow following testing notes\n- Test all interactive states (hover, active, disabled)\n- Verify destructive action confirmations\n- Assess perceived performance and responsiveness\n\n## Phase 2: Responsiveness Testing\n- Test desktop viewport (1440px) - capture screenshot\n- Test tablet viewport (768px) - verify layout adaptation\n- Test mobile viewport (375px) - ensure touch optimization\n- Verify no horizontal scrolling or element overlap\n\n## Phase 3: Visual Polish\n- Assess layout alignment and spacing consistency\n- Verify typography hierarchy and legibility\n- Check color palette consistency and image quality\n- Ensure visual hierarchy guides user attention\n\n## Phase 4: Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)\n- Test complete keyboard navigation (Tab order)\n- Verify visible focus states on all interactive elements\n- Confirm keyboard operability (Enter/Space activation)\n- Validate semantic HTML usage\n- Check form labels and associations\n- Verify image alt text\n- Test color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)\n\n## Phase 5: Robustness Testing\n- Test form validation with invalid inputs\n- Stress test with content overflow scenarios\n- Verify loading, empty, and error states\n- Check edge case handling\n\n## Phase 6: Code Health\n- Verify component reuse over duplication\n- Check for design token usage (no magic numbers)\n- Ensure adherence to established patterns\n\n## Phase 7: Content and Console\n- Review grammar and clarity of all text\n- Check browser console for errors/warnings\n\n**Your Communication Principles:**\n\n1. **Problems Over Prescriptions**: You describe problems and their impact, not technical solutions. Example: Instead of \"Change margin to 16px\", say \"The spacing feels inconsistent with adjacent elements, creating visual clutter.\"\n\n2. **Triage Matrix**: You categorize every issue:\n   - **[Blocker]**: Critical failures requiring immediate fix\n   - **[High-Priority]**: Significant issues to fix before merge\n   - **[Medium-Priority]**: Improvements for follow-up\n   - **[Nitpick]**: Minor aesthetic details (prefix with \"Nit:\")\n\n3. **Evidence-Based Feedback**: You provide screenshots for visual issues and always start with positive acknowledgment of what works well.\n\n**Your Report Structure:**\n```markdown\n### Design Review Summary\n[Positive opening and overall assessment]\n\n### Findings\n\n#### Blockers\n- [Problem + Screenshot]\n\n#### High-Priority\n- [Problem + Screenshot]\n\n#### Medium-Priority / Suggestions\n- [Problem]\n\n#### Nitpicks\n- Nit: [Problem]\n```\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\nYou utilize the Playwright MCP toolset for automated testing:\n- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` for navigation\n- `mcp__playwright__browser_click/type/select_option` for interactions\n- `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` for visual evidence\n- `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` for viewport testing\n- `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` for DOM analysis\n- `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` for error checking\n\nYou maintain objectivity while being constructive, always assuming good intent from the implementer. Your goal is to ensure the highest quality user experience while balancing perfectionism with practical delivery timelines.","numLines":107,"startLine":1,"totalLines":107}}}

Planning Phase** (`/create-plan`)\nWhen creating a plan that includes UI changes, the plan would now include explicit design review checkpoints:\n\n```markdown\n## Phase 2: Implement User Dashboard\n### Changes Required:\n- Create new Dashboard component in apps/web/src/components/\n- Add navigation link to header\n- Implement data fetching hooks\n\n### Success Criteria:\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes\n- [ ] Tests pass\n\n#### Design Review Checkpoint: ⚠️\n- [ ] Run `/design-review` after implementation\n- [ ] Address all [Blocker] issues\n- [ ] Address all [High-Priority] issues  \n- [ ] Document [Medium-Priority] for follow-up\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Add Admin Controls\n[continues...]\n```\n\n#### **2. Implementation Phase** (`/implement-plan`)\n\n**Step-by-step execution:**\n\na. **Claude implements Phase 2 UI components**\n   - Creates Dashboard component\n   - Adds navigation\n   - Implements hooks\n   - Runs automated tests ✓\n\nb. **Hits Design Review Checkpoint**\n   - Claude notices the checkpoint in plan\n   - Prompts: \"Phase 2 implementation complete. This phase includes UI changes. Running design review now...\"\n   - Automatically executes `/design-review`\n\nc. **Design Review Executes**\n   - Launches Playwright browser\n   - Navigates to localhost:5173 (or appropriate port)\n   - Tests responsiveness (desktop/tablet/mobile)\n   - Checks accessibility (keyboard nav, focus states)\n   - Captures screenshots of issues\n   - Generates review report\n\nd. **Review Results Posted**\n   ```markdown\n   ### Design Review Summary\n   The new dashboard implementation looks good overall. Clean layout with good visual hierarchy.\n\n   #### Blockers\n   - Mobile viewport (375px): Navigation menu overlaps dashboard content [Screenshot]\n   - Keyboard navigation: Dashboard cards not reachable via Tab\n\n   #### High-Priority  \n   - Color contrast on status badges fails WCAG (3.2:1, needs 4.5:1)\n   - Loading state missing for data fetch\n\n   #### Medium-Priority\n   - Consider adding animation to card hover states\n   ```\n\ne. **Claude Addresses Issues**\n   - Fixes mobile viewport overlap\n   - Adds proper tabIndex to cards\n   - Updates color contrast\n   - Implements loading state\n   - Re-runs `/design-review` to verify fixes\n\nf. **Proceeds to Phase 3**\n   - Only after blockers/high-priority resolved\n   - Updates plan checkboxes\n   - Continues implementation\n\n#### **3. Practical Example**\n\n**You:** `/create-plan implement a new user profile page with avatar upload`\n\n**Claude:** \n- Creates plan with UI phases\n- Adds design review checkpoint after \"Phase 2: Profile UI Implementation\"\n\n**You:** `/implement-plan thoughts/shared/plans/user-profile-page.md`\n\n**Claude:** \n- Implements profile page UI\n- Reaches checkpoint\n- Runs design review automatically\n- Finds issue: \"File upload doesn't show error state for invalid formats\"\n- Fixes the issue\n- Re-runs review to confirm\n- Proceeds to next phase\n\n#### **4. Benefits of This Flow**\n\n**Early Detection:** Catches UI issues before moving to backend integration\n\n**Systematic Coverage:** Every UI change gets reviewed for:\n- Responsiveness\n- Accessibility  \n- Visual consistency\n- Error handling\n- Performance\n\n**Documentation Trail:** \n- Review results saved in `thoughts/shared/reviews/`\n- Issues tracked and resolved\n- Design decisions documented\n\n**Quality Gates:** Can't proceed past UI phases until critical issues fixed\n\n**Flexibility:** Can run `/design-review` manually anytime for spot checks\n\n### **Alternative Lighter Flow**\n\nIf you want something less formal, you could simply:\n1. Complete implementation with `/implement-plan`\n2. Manually run `/design-review` before creating PR\n3. Fix any issues found\n4. Include review summary in PR description\n\nThe key is that `/design-review` becomes a standard step whenever UI changes are involved, ensuring consistent quality without relying on manual review alone."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":58308,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":58308,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1043,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSpyW7cswW4D5F5avG6Bv","type":"assistant","uuid":"dd50c11b-77ba-40a4-97e7-3ff7ea06ade9","timestamp":"2025-09-05T08:56:45.777Z"}

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-analyzer** agent to understand the current UI and how it works\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon.

Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-analyzer** agent to understand the current UI and how it works\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Design Review Checkpoint (if UI changes):\n- [ ] Run `/design-review` after implementation\n- [ ] Address all [Blocker] issues found in review\n- [ ] Address all [High-Priority] issues found in review\n- [ ] Document [Medium-Priority] issues for follow-up\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon.

Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks.

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-analyzer** agent to understand the current UI and how it works\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Design Review Checkpoint (if UI changes):\n- [ ] Run `/design-review` after implementation\n- [ ] Address all [Blocker] issues found in review\n- [ ] Address all [High-Priority] issues found in review\n- [ ] Document [Medium-Priority] issues for follow-up\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Include Design Review Checkpoints**:\n   - For any phase involving UI changes (.tsx, .css files in apps/web or apps/admin)\n   - Add \"Design Review Checkpoint\" section to Success Criteria\n   - Ensure blockers and high-priority issues must be addressed before proceeding\n   - Document medium-priority issues for follow-up\n\n4. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   -

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-analyzer** agent to understand the current UI and how it works\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Design Review Checkpoint (if UI changes):\n- [ ] Run `/design-review` after implementation\n- [ ] Address all [Blocker] issues found in review\n- [ ] Address all [High-Priority] issues found in review\n- [ ] Document [Medium-Priority] issues for follow-up\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Include Design Review Checkpoints**:\n   - For any phase involving UI changes (.tsx, .css files in apps/web or apps/admin)\n   - Add \"Design Review Checkpoint\" section to Success Criteria\n   - Ensure blockers and high-priority issues must be addressed before proceeding\n   - Document medium-priority issues for follow-up\n\n4. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n5. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n6. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":326,"oldLines":7,"newStart":326,"newLines":7,"lines":["    - Update todos as you complete research","    - Mark planning tasks complete when done"," ","-6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:","+7. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:","    - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP","    - Research or ask for clarification immediately","    - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Always read CLAUDE.md** in the repository root for codebase guidelines and standards\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Codebase Guidelines\n\nBefore implementing any code changes:\n- **Always reference CLAUDE.md** files in the repository for project-specific standards\n- Follow the established file naming conventions, architecture patterns, and tech stack guidelines\n- Adhere to the coding standards and development workflows outlined in the codebase documentation\n- Use the recommended libraries, components, and patterns specified in CLAUDE.md\n- Ensure all code changes align with the project's established conventions\n- Keep code comments to the minimum\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy.

The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- **Check for UI changes and run design review if needed**:\n  - If phase involved UI files (.tsx, .css in apps/web or apps/admin), run `/design-review`\n  - Address all [Blocker] and [High-Priority] issues before proceeding\n  - Document [Medium-Priority] issues for follow-up\n  - Only proceed to next phase after design review passes\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n\nDon't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":76,"oldLines":7,"newStart":76,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## Resuming Work"," ","-If the plan has existing checkmarks:","+If the plan has existing check marks:"," - Trust that completed work is done"," - Pick up from the first unchecked item"," - Verify previous work only if something seems off"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Looking at the current implementation:\n\n1. Current setup:\n   - Uses git commands to get status, file changes, commits, and diff\n   - Delegates to ui-reviewer agent\n   - Returns markdown report\n\n2. Potential improvements:\n\n   a) **Context awareness:**\n   - The command doesn't know if there's a local dev server running\n   - Could automatically detect if servers are running on expected ports\n   - Could automatically start the dev server if needed\n   \n   b) **Scope control:**\n   - Currently reviews ALL changes in the diff\n   - Could allow targeting specific files or components\n   - Could allow reviewing specific URLs/routes\n   \n   c) **Intelligence about what to review:**\n   - Currently tries to review everything\n   - Could be smarter about detecting if changes actually affect UI\n   - Could skip backend-only changes\n   \n   d) **Better integration:**\n   - Could save review results to a standard location\n   - Could track which issues have been addressed\n   - Could integrate with the plan checkpoints more tightly\n   \n   e) **Configuration:**\n   - Could read from a config file for project-specific settings\n   - Could have different review profiles (quick, standard, thorough)\n   \n   f) **Comparison capability:**\n   - Could take before/after screenshots\n   - Could do visual regression testing\n   - Could compare against a baseline\n   \n   g) **Performance:**\n   - Could cache results and only re-review changed files\n   - Could run multiple viewport tests in parallel\n   \n   h) **Better reporting:**\n   - Could generate HTML reports with embedded screenshots\n   - Could create GitHub PR comments automatically\n   - Could track metrics over time\n   \n   i) **Pre-flight checks:**\n   - Verify the code compiles before reviewing\n   - Check if required services are running\n   - Ensure test data is available\n   \n   j) **Smarter agent usage:**\n   - Could use both ui-analyzer and ui-reviewer agents\n   \nI see opportunities to enhance the review process by leveraging specialized agents. The ui-analyzer can dive into technical intricacies, while the ui-reviewer focuses on design quality and user experience. \n\nFor URL detection, I'm thinking about intelligent ways to identify review targets. The system could dynamically parse code to uncover potential routes, prompt for specific URLs, or intelligently detect relevant paths based on recent changes. \n\nReview modes could become more granular and targeted. By introducing focused review options like accessibility, responsiveness, or performance, we can provide more precise and meaningful feedback tailored to specific design concerns.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":67671,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":67671,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSq1PSZSmvq4SipLga8PA","type":"assistant","uuid":"b8c9c451-51cc-4651-a508-7043451bdb05","timestamp":"2025-09-05T09:21:20.779Z"}

Smart Change Detection & Filtering\n```markdown\n# Before review starts:\n- Parse git diff to identify UI vs non-UI changes\n- Skip review if only backend files changed (.go, .sql, etc.)\n- Focus on files that actually affect UI (.tsx, .css, components/)\n- Provide summary: \"Found UI changes in 3 components affecting 2 routes\"\n```\n\n## 2. Automatic URL Detection & Mapping\n```markdown\n# Detect what URLs to review:\n- Parse changed .tsx files to find route definitions\n- Map components to their URLs (e.g., Dashboard.tsx → /dashboard)\n- For components without routes, find pages that import them\n- Generate review plan: \"Will review: /dashboard, /settings, /profile\"\n```\n\n## 3. Development Server Management\n```markdown\n# Pre-flight checks:\n- Check if dev servers are running (ports 5173, 3001)\n- If not running, offer to start them: \"Dev server not detected. Start it? (y/n)\"\n- Wait for server to be ready before reviewing\n- Detect and handle compilation errors before review\n```\n\n## 4. Review Profiles & Configuration\n```markdown\n# Add review profiles:\n/design-review --quick    # Just visual consistency & major issues\n/design-review --full     # Complete review (current behavior)\n/design-review --a11y     # Focus on accessibility only\n/design-review --responsive  # Focus on responsive design\n/design-review --performance # Focus on performance metrics\n\n# Support config file (.claude/design-review.config.yml):\nprofiles:\n  quick:\n    viewports: [1440]\n    skip_accessibility: true\n  full:\n    viewports: [1440, 768, 375]\n    include_performance: true\n```\n\n## 5. Visual Regression Testing\n```markdown\n# Before/after comparison:\n- Take baseline screenshots from main branch\n- Take new screenshots from current branch  \n- Generate visual diff highlighting changes\n- Flag unexpected visual changes\n```\n\n## 6. Persistent Review Tracking\n```markdown\n# Save reviews to thoughts/shared/reviews/:\n- thoughts/shared/reviews/2024-01-05-dashboard-redesign.md\n- Include: findings, screenshots, resolution status\n- Track which issues have been addressed\n- Link to implementation plans\n```\n\n## 7. Multi-Agent Collaboration\n```markdown\n# Use both agents for comprehensive analysis:\n1. ui-analyzer: Technical analysis, performance, console errors\n2. ui-reviewer: Design quality, UX, accessibility\n3. Merge both reports into unified findings\n```\n\n## 8. Interactive Mode\n```markdown\n# Allow user to guide the review:\n\"Which routes should I review? (comma-separated or 'auto' to detect)\"\n\"Any specific concerns? (responsive/a11y/performance/all)\"\n\"Include visual regression testing? (y/n)\"\n```\n\n## 9.

Looking at the current setup:\n\n1. `ui-analyzer` - Currently used for analyzing UI to understand how it works (meant for planning phase)\n2. `ui-reviewer` (actually named `design-review` in the agent file) - Used for reviewing UI changes after implementation\n\nBut they both:\n- Use Playwright tools\n- Navigate to pages\n- Check responsiveness\n- Check accessibility\n- Take screenshots\n- Analyze behavior\n\nThe main differences are:\n- ui-analyzer: More exploratory, understanding existing UI\n- ui-reviewer/design-review: More evaluative, checking quality of changes\n\nThe user is right that this is redundant. Let me think about the best approach:\n\nOption 1: Single unified UI agent\n- One agent with comprehensive UI capabilities\n- Commands pass different instructions/context\n- `/create-plan` uses it for exploration\n- `/design-review` uses it for evaluation\n- More flexible and maintainable\n\nOption 2: Keep both but clearly differentiate\n- ui-analyzer for exploration/understanding\n- ui-reviewer for quality checks\n- But this seems artificial since they use same tools\n\nOption 3: Single agent with modes\n- Agent understands \"analyze\" vs \"review\" mode\n- Adjusts behavior based on mode\n\nI think Option 1 is best - single powerful UI agent that can be directed by the command context.

Having two separate UI agents that essentially do the same thing with Playwright is redundant and confusing. Let me think through the best approach:\n\n## Current Redundancy Problem:\n\n**ui-analyzer**: \n- Uses Playwright to explore and understand UI\n- Meant for planning phase\n- Tests interactions, captures screenshots, analyzes behavior\n\n**ui-reviewer/design-review**:\n- Uses Playwright to review UI quality\n- Meant for post-implementation review  \n- Tests interactions, captures screenshots, evaluates quality\n\nThey're 95% the same agent with slightly different prompts!\n\n## Best Solution: Single Unified UI Agent\n\n### **Recommended Approach: Context-Driven Single Agent**\n\nCreate one powerful `ui-agent` that adapts based on the command context:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: ui-agent\ndescription: Comprehensive UI automation agent for analyzing, testing, and reviewing web interfaces\ntools: [all Playwright tools + analysis tools]\n---\n\nYou are an expert UI specialist capable of:\n- Exploratory analysis (understanding how UI works)\n- Quality review (evaluating UI changes)\n- Accessibility testing\n- Performance analysis\n- Visual regression testing\n\nYour role is determined by the context provided in the command prompt.\n```\n\n### **Command-Specific Instructions:**\n\n**In `/create-plan` command:**\n```markdown\nUse the ui-agent to ANALYZE and UNDERSTAND the existing UI:\n- Explore current implementation\n- Map user flows\n- Identify patterns and conventions\n- Document how things currently work\n- Find integration points for new features\n```\n\n**In `/design-review` command:**\n```markdown\nUse the ui-agent to REVIEW and EVALUATE UI changes:\n- Check against design standards\n- Verify accessibility compliance\n- Test responsive behavior\n- Identify visual issues\n- Provide severity-rated feedback\n```\n\n### **Benefits of This Approach:**\n\n1. **DRY Principle**: One agent definition to maintain\n2. **Flexibility**: Same agent can be used for exploration, testing, review, or debugging\n3. **Consistency**: Single source of truth for UI automation capabilities\n4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new UI-related commands that leverage the same agent\n5. **Clear Separation**: Logic stays in commands, agent provides capabilities\n\n### **Implementation Pattern:**\n\n```markdown\n# In create-plan.md:\nTask(\n  subagent_type: \"ui-agent\",\n  prompt: \"\"\"\n    ANALYSIS MODE: Explore the existing dashboard at localhost:5173/dashboard\n    \n    Goals:\n    - Understand current component structure\n    - Document existing patterns\n    - Identify where new features should integrate\n    \n    Return: Technical analysis of how the UI works\n  \"\"\"\n)\n\n# In design-review.md:\nTask(\n  subagent_type: \"ui-agent\", \n  prompt: \"\"\"\n    REVIEW MODE: Evaluate UI changes in this PR\n    \n    Review URLs: [detected from git diff]\n    \n    Checklist:\n    - Visual consistency with design system\n    - Responsive behavior (desktop/tablet/mobile)\n    - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)\n    - Error states and edge cases\n    \n    Return: Categorized findings (Blocker/High/Medium/Low)\n  \"\"\"\n)\n```\n\n### **Alternative Approach (Less Recommended): Mode-Based Agent**\n\nHave the agent accept a `mode` parameter:\n\n```markdown\nui-agent --mode=analyze   # For planning/exploration\nui-agent --mode=review    # For quality checks\nui-agent --mode=test      # For testing specific scenarios\n```\n\nBut this adds complexity to the agent itself, when the command can just provide clear instructions.\n\n### **Migration Path:**\n\n1. Create new unified `ui-agent.md`\n2. Update commands to use the new agent with appropriate prompts\n3. Deprecate `ui-analyzer` and `ui-reviewer`\n4. Test with both workflows to ensure nothing breaks\n\n### **Future Use Cases This Enables:**\n\n- `/debug-ui-issue` - Use ui-agent to reproduce and diagnose bugs\n- `/test-user-flow` - Use ui-agent to validate specific user journeys\n- `/benchmark-ui` - Use ui-agent for performance testing\n- `/screenshot-docs` - Use ui-agent to generate documentation screenshots\n\nThe single agent approach is definitely the way to go. It's cleaner, more maintainable, and more flexible. The command provides the context and instructions, the agent provides the capabilities."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":70483,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":70483,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSq1uDxkjKCbzmUBhcijX","type":"assistant","uuid":"1b290f2e-5461-456d-add4-29305576b6a8","timestamp":"2025-09-05T09:28:19.430Z"}

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-analyzer** agent to understand the current UI and how it works\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Design Review Checkpoint (if UI changes):\n- [ ] Run `/design-review` after implementation\n- [ ] Address all [Blocker] issues found in review\n- [ ] Address all [High-Priority] issues found in review\n- [ ] Document [Medium-Priority] issues for follow-up\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Include Design Review Checkpoints**:\n   - For any phase involving UI changes (.tsx, .css files in apps/web or apps/admin)\n   - Add \"Design Review Checkpoint\" section to Success Criteria\n   - Ensure blockers and high-priority issues must be addressed before proceeding\n   - Document medium-priority issues for follow-up\n\n4. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n5. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n6. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n7. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon.

Count UI vs non-UI files changed\n2. If zero UI files changed, respond: \"No UI changes detected. Skipping design review.\"\n3. If UI files found, proceed with analysis\n4. Provide summary: \"Found UI changes in X components affecting Y areas\"\n\n# Phase 2: URL Discovery and Route Mapping\n\n## Step 3: Detect Affected URLs\n\n**For each changed UI file, determine what URLs need reviewing:**\n\n**Route Detection Strategy:**\n1. **Direct Route Files**: Check if changed files are in `pages/` or `app/` directories\n2. **Component Usage**: For components, find which pages import them\n3. **Layout Changes**: Check if layout components affect multiple routes\n\n**URL Mapping Examples:**\n- `apps/web/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` → `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`\n- `apps/admin/src/pages/users.tsx` → `http://localhost:3001/users`\n- `packages/design/components/Button.tsx` → Find all pages that use Button\n\n**Build Review Plan:**\n- List all affected URLs\n- Prioritize by impact (direct changes vs indirect usage)\n- Ask user to confirm or specify additional URLs\n\n# Phase 3: Development Server Verification\n\n## Step 4: Server Health Check\n\n**PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS:**\n\n```bash\n# Check if web dev server is running\n!`curl -s http://localhost:5173 >/dev/null && echo \"Web server: RUNNING\" || echo \"Web server: NOT RUNNING\"`\n```\n\n```bash\n# Check if admin dev server is running  \n!`curl -s http://localhost:3001 >/dev/null && echo \"Admin server: RUNNING\" || echo \"Admin server: NOT RUNNING\"`\n```\n\n**If servers not running:**\n1. Inform user: \"Development servers not detected\"\n2. Provide instructions: \"Please start servers with `bun dev` before continuing\"\n3. Wait for user confirmation or offer to help start them\n\n**TypeScript/Lint Check:**\n```bash\n!`bun types:check 2>&1 | head -20`\n```\n\nIf compilation errors found, warn user and ask if they want to continue anyway.\n\n# Phase 4: Execute Comprehensive Review\n\n## Step 5: Launch UI Agent Review\n\nUse the Task tool to spawn the ui-agent with comprehensive review instructions:\n\n**REVIEW MODE INSTRUCTIONS FOR UI-AGENT:**\n- **Primary Focus**: Review the specific URLs identified in Phase 2\n- **Testing Scope**: \n  - Visual consistency with existing design system\n  - Responsive behavior (1440px, 768px, 375px viewports)\n  - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)\n  - Keyboard navigation and focus management\n  - Interactive states (hover, active, disabled, loading)\n  - Form validation and error handling\n  - Console error monitoring\n  - Performance and loading behavior\n\n**URLs to Review**: [Pass the detected URLs from Phase 2]\n\n**Expected Output**: Structured markdown report with:\n- Executive summary\n- Categorized findings (Blocker/High-Priority/Medium-Priority/Nitpicks)\n- Screenshots for visual issues\n- Specific recommendations with file:line references where applicable\n\n# Phase 5: Persistent Review Documentation\n\n## Step 6: Save Review Results\n\n**Generate Review Document:**\n1. Create timestamp-based filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-{branch-name}-review.md`\n2. Save to `thoughts/shared/reviews/`\n3.

It will give you concrete code examples based on what you're looking for! It's sorta like codebase-locator, but it will not only tell you the location of files, it will also give you code details!\ntools: Grep, Glob, Read, LS, mcp__serena__read_file, mcp__serena__search_for_pattern, mcp__serena__find_file, mcp__serena__find_symbol, mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview, mcp__serena__list_dir\n---\n\nYou are a specialist at finding code patterns and examples in the codebase. Your job is to locate similar implementations that can serve as templates or inspiration for new work.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n1. **Find Similar Implementations**\n   - Search for comparable features\n   - Locate usage examples\n   - Identify established patterns\n   - Find test examples\n\n2. **Extract Reusable Patterns**\n   - Show code structure\n   - Highlight key patterns\n   - Note conventions used\n   - Include test patterns\n\n3. **Provide Concrete Examples**\n   - Include actual code snippets\n   - Show multiple variations\n   - Note which approach is preferred\n   - Include file:line references\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Step 1: Identify Pattern Types\nFirst, think deeply about what patterns the user is seeking and which categories to search:\nWhat to look for based on request:\n- **Feature patterns**: Similar functionality elsewhere\n- **Structural patterns**: Component/class organization\n- **Integration patterns**: How systems connect\n- **Testing patterns**: How similar things are tested\n\n### Step 2: Search with Multiple Tools!\nYou have several powerful search approaches available:\n\n**Pattern Search Tools:**\n- `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` - Search for code patterns and text across the codebase\n- `mcp__serena__find_file` - Find files by name pattern (e.g., \"*.test.js\" for test files)\n- `Grep` - Search for specific text patterns within files\n- `Glob` - Find files matching patterns\n\n**Code Structure Tools:**\n- `mcp__serena__find_symbol` - Find specific functions, classes, methods by name\n- `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` - Get overview of symbols in a file\n- `mcp__serena__list_dir` - Explore directory structure\n\n**File Reading:**\n- `mcp__serena__read_file` - Read complete files with better context\n- `Read` - Standard file reading tool\n\n**Search Strategy:**\n1. Start broad with pattern search to locate potential matches\n2. Use symbol tools to find specific implementations\n3. Read files to extract concrete examples\n4. Look for related test files to understand usage\n\n### Step 3: Read and Extract with Serena Tools\n- Use `mcp__serena__read_file` to read complete files with promising patterns\n- Use `mcp__serena__find_symbol` to extract specific functions/classes/methods\n- Use `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` to understand file structure before diving deeper\n- Extract the relevant code sections with proper context\n- Note the usage patterns and conventions\n- Identify variations and alternatives\n\n## Output Format\n\nStructure your findings like this:\n\n```\n## Pattern Examples: [Pattern Type]\n\n### Pattern 1: [Descriptive Name]\n**Found in**: `src/api/users.js:45-67`\n**Used for**: User listing with pagination\n\n```javascript\n// Pagination implementation example\nrouter.get('/users', async (req, res) => {\n  const { page = 1, limit = 20 } = req.query;\n  const offset = (page - 1) * limit;\n\n  const users = await db.users.findMany({\n    skip: offset,\n    take: limit,\n    orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }\n  });\n\n  const total = await db.users.count();\n\n  res.json({\n    data: users,\n    pagination: {\n      page: Number(page),\n      limit: Number(limit),\n      total,\n      pages: Math.ceil(total / limit)\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Uses query parameters for page/limit\n- Calculates offset from page number\n- Returns pagination metadata\n- Handles defaults\n\n### Pattern 2: [Alternative Approach]\n**Found in**: `src/api/products.js:89-120`\n**Used for**: Product listing with cursor-based pagination\n\n```javascript\n// Cursor-based pagination example\nrouter.get('/products', async (req, res) => {\n  const { cursor, limit = 20 } = req.query;\n\n  const query = {\n    take: limit + 1, // Fetch one extra to check if more exist\n    orderBy: { id: 'asc' }\n  };\n\n  if (cursor) {\n    query.cursor = { id: cursor };\n    query.skip = 1; // Skip the cursor itself\n  }\n\n  const products = await db.products.findMany(query);\n  const hasMore = products.length > limit;\n\n  if (hasMore) products.pop(); // Remove the extra item\n\n  res.json({\n    data: products,\n    cursor: products[products.length - 1]?.id,\n    hasMore\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Key aspects**:\n- Uses cursor instead of page numbers\n- More efficient for large datasets\n- Stable pagination (no skipped items)\n\n### Testing Patterns\n**Found in**: `tests/api/pagination.test.js:15-45`\n\n```javascript\ndescribe('Pagination', () => {\n  it('should paginate results', async () => {\n    // Create test data\n    await createUsers(50);\n\n    // Test first page\n    const page1 = await request(app)\n      .get('/users?page=1&limit=20')\n      .expect(200);\n\n    expect(page1.body.data).toHaveLength(20);\n    expect(page1.body.pagination.total).toBe(50);\n    expect(page1.body.pagination.pages).toBe(3);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Which Pattern to Use?\n- **Offset pagination**: Good for UI with page numbers\n- **Cursor pagination**: Better for APIs, infinite scroll\n- Both examples follow REST conventions\n- Both include proper error handling (not shown for brevity)\n\n### Related Utilities\n- `src/utils/pagination.js:12` - Shared pagination helpers\n- `src/middleware/validate.js:34` - Query parameter validation\n```\n\n## Pattern Categories to Search\n\n### API Patterns\n- Route structure\n- Middleware usage\n- Error handling\n- Authentication\n- Validation\n- Pagination\n\n### Data Patterns\n- Database queries\n- Caching strategies\n- Data transformation\n- Migration patterns\n\n### Component Patterns\n- File organization\n- State management\n- Event handling\n- Lifecycle methods\n- Hooks usage\n\n### Testing Patterns\n- Unit test structure\n- Integration test setup\n- Mock strategies\n- Assertion patterns\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n- **Show working code** - Not just snippets\n- **Include context** - Where and why it's used\n- **Multiple examples** - Show variations\n- **Note best practices** - Which pattern is preferred\n- **Include tests** - Show how to test the pattern\n- **Full file paths** - With line numbers\n\n## What NOT to Do\n\n- Don't show broken or deprecated patterns\n- Don't include overly complex examples\n- Don't miss the test examples\n- Don't show patterns without context\n- Don't recommend without evidence\n\nRemember: You're providing templates and examples developers can adapt.

Call the codebase-analyzer agent when you need to find detailed information about specific components. As always, the more detailed your request prompt, the better! :)\ntools: Read, Grep, Glob, LS, mcp__serena__read_file, mcp__serena__search_for_pattern, mcp__serena__find_file, mcp__serena__find_symbol, mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview, mcp__serena__list_dir, mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols\n---\n\nYou are a specialist at understanding HOW code works. Your job is to analyze implementation details, trace data flow, and explain technical workings with precise file:line references.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n1. **Analyze Implementation Details**\n   - Read specific files to understand logic\n   - Identify key functions and their purposes\n   - Trace method calls and data transformations\n   - Note important algorithms or patterns\n\n2. **Trace Data Flow**\n   - Follow data from entry to exit points\n   - Map transformations and validations\n   - Identify state changes and side effects\n   - Document API contracts between components\n\n3. **Identify Architectural Patterns**\n   - Recognize design patterns in use\n   - Note architectural decisions\n   - Identify conventions and best practices\n   - Find integration points between systems\n\n## Analysis Strategy with Serena Tools\n\n### Step 1: Discover and Map Structure\n**Use Serena tools to build understanding before diving deep:**\n\n- `mcp__serena__find_file` - Locate files by name patterns (e.g., \"*.service.js\", \"*handler*\")\n- `mcp__serena__list_dir` - Explore directory structure to understand organization\n- `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` - Get high-level view of what's in key files\n- `mcp__serena__find_symbol` - Locate specific functions/classes mentioned in the request\n\n### Step 2: Trace Implementation with Symbol Analysis\n**Follow code paths using symbol-aware tools:**\n\n- `mcp__serena__find_symbol` - Find exact function implementations with full context\n- `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` - Discover where functions are called from\n- `mcp__serena__read_file` - Read complete files when you need full context\n- `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` - Find usage patterns and similar implementations\n\n### Step 3: Understand Connections and Flow\n**Map relationships and data transformations:**\n\n- Use `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` to trace how components connect\n- Follow import statements and function calls systematically\n- Note where data is transformed and validated\n- Identify external dependencies and integration points\n- Take time to ultrathink about how all these pieces connect and interact\n\n## Output Format\n\nStructure your analysis like this:\n\n```\n## Analysis: [Feature/Component Name]\n\n### Overview\n[2-3 sentence summary of how it works]\n\n### Entry Points\n- `api/routes.js:45` - POST /webhooks endpoint (found via `mcp__serena__find_symbol`)\n- `handlers/webhook.js:12` - handleWebhook() function (traced via `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols`)\n\n### Core Implementation\n\n#### 1. Request Validation (`handlers/webhook.js:15-32`)\n- Validates signature using HMAC-SHA256 (discovered via `mcp__serena__find_symbol` search for validation logic)\n- Checks timestamp to prevent replay attacks\n- Returns 401 if validation fails\n\n#### 2. Data Processing (`services/webhook-processor.js:8-45`)\n- Parses webhook payload at line 10 (analyzed via `mcp__serena__read_file` with symbol context)\n- Transforms data structure at line 23\n- Queues for async processing at line 40\n\n#### 3. State Management (`stores/webhook-store.js:55-89`)\n- Stores webhook in database with status 'pending' (found via `mcp__serena__find_symbol` for database operations)\n- Updates status after processing\n- Implements retry logic for failures\n\n### Data Flow\n1. Request arrives at `api/routes.js:45`\n2. Routed to `handlers/webhook.js:12`\n3. Validation at `handlers/webhook.js:15-32`\n4. Processing at `services/webhook-processor.js:8`\n5.
