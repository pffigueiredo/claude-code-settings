You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n   - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n   - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```\n\nARGUMENTS: chagne the existing plan.

Let me investigate the current admin UI implementation to understand what's missing.","signature":"EoEKCkYIBxgCKkBBS7ibgajtH6eRkyYZuCAq9KLEyRiix3m2Vf0VoRwHhCRiuyyvBG7WapqR4Mi+wvn9zIM17gVDyspykF4Pm60mEgw2Gat+2Bxq1Vcv8fIaDOBfUBiw1W3qmZPAdyIwek1eLjeTWnFqgF3gdQkTe/bq+iqdPcmxz884HUnbhCiFTLpVflaN1mGna9hNwniQKugIneHOjwAfErrvaW1YXnJpItUb7EKyY2n5+MObmFEthSz+9J9HgR62qDFiwe0PSoTsbd6Tzhf10rImt5c+YlrRUAhWO69bH/9FAaE3z7s8BqrAV0NqwmOlyc2iOOwEsNYNnCCZ7CpzSN70EI4Vx/zr8A3oGi+bxpJ8dz9HB3n4ZgPB8/P+DA+RD4T8HoGxpi1aeBNQcNPvrJQflGT/vV9ODrc6fD0mr2vDYJoRo71zPAcsuE5UJWsWnKUifeQwC816QgJxq+6sSQ2PhImoVfTFuBWhNF/3voK3HONRFLNvio1BVrbUR8Shu30STAcOvHp6ieX9xLsHTq+KMwyscqiLJpc65eNIDX1A0xW3UPXyKIqfqhzY9fI3sL3gs7l+M/niIGV0ongNZF25Su8mIqkS5skq80qEm8/xHoyKsNrlEVnCFaKxdOnvDqkqfH/T7tyUDACZ5FR8TZ6rDX3lEQIBepTIABTGIs/ARG+mdYGQVxYYq5gYJBkN/KfxQrMPHCMZifYgxNfAWCwsgRVicFLYGDC4thC3EFUxo7QTZRZuRAUsMxBmyzJse5v0JJBoFY0WBQ/9fcW1/8/KmipoHBB1eK4FH6ZpsPVOEg7LOsXqnsq5pNNWSjvyuF/h5TnL0D2I9+wOsSrdfsL3Ceo1H60dr3gY5nl1UlJczURFspg7CPniFQPNl1wRWFp3fNfFz2mUapn9//NLPuscrCr6H81ud6hCkGBbhxCSWSMsUWjOBnG/VEibVUiXX+M4XIcikn3jzlSqlquuFRSLwQyi57kimhF3HBrzEzhdpHPpPN+yfK03wWgFzTPZwm5XVfAkZxbDdpSG6bbVa/1k5ngLrnQfGwMncW9NRflkb7NbtEWgCL9MoLFJcn1uqVAOzCwCodLczdfHg4sBgSovErDDnOLJrij9Yw8LmNHWhK04k1a0ze7ag2nPQDQ9nd/UHBge2ITnKRS/cj9hSv/j1IFEP/ubQWZQtSilmo2LnJB8OoaIwuxfX3/a/sYBFrV4sITwRCDcjhriJPWziRCuiOUi8+V0SLThm8h/zKQKkH+4r38gNo3ZiH308NFZ2l1x9L2N5JWyjBCNGcmSMlGkyAt8b/+/A5FvWGid23mrH1Cja3nxd2uGoAv0tqAgtaqcQLI8WlMnD7LiOu8zronKPwPEPwe614bp9WgD1ecEQSZDfVJwa92wfuklJH6/P9irpNDkDyt4TL2vpzzcEzFdiGVcsnCyKcrbUB9FW4r3hK3G3+VOPlzwaMiJCeH0dK79ewXJz2lc1UQLAAQ4gBXOpKy65wb01Da94nXMN7L/+gxtMzZjczfu9xfSNn8918DjZhi4DaEXCWsA8knehKm+OjMeLkL8VYLGree0gtU/ABUQcZkbvWj1GBsM8qOM7DbgT+WMvpRcwfvueU8QvcYHGMQXYbzAy38Dw5tWOdq5VTirUCm8wsnNZc/AJ/MyZn79DJW76Z32sjPbd8RlxD5F0nvTmEOtLAKRsynSlk94GAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":13,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3665,"cache_read_input_tokens":42580,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3665,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CShVnsC9eUL6JiyWrE2nw","type":"assistant","uuid":"2230a2f9-1035-4e88-9645-7519346daecd","timestamp":"2025-09-01T10:08:53.142Z"}

Update the frontend data provider to use the admin endpoint when available.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nUpdate the React Admin data provider to use the admin delete endpoint for app deletions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin-Specific Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Single app delete works from admin interface\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear\n- [ ] Failed deletes show error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and select an app owned by another user\n3. Click delete button and verify deletion succeeds\n4. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n5. Test bulk delete with multiple apps from different owners\n6. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist\n7. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin endpoint\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":46,"oldLines":7,"newStart":46,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," - Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic"," - Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)","-- Adding new admin UI components (existing DeleteButton/BulkDeleteButton work)","+- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton/BulkDeleteButton exist but aren't exposed)"," - Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access"," - Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Admin-Specific Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Single app delete works from admin interface\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear\n- [ ] Failed deletes show error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and select an app owned by another user\n3. Click delete button and verify deletion succeeds\n4. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n5. Test bulk delete with multiple apps from different owners\n6. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist\n7. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin endpoint\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":18,"oldLines":14,"newStart":18,"newLines":18,"lines":[" "," **Admin Frontend:**"," - React Admin framework with existing DeleteButton and BulkDeleteButton components","-- Data provider expects delete endpoint to work for any app admin can see","-- Proper undoable mutations and toast notifications already implemented","+- Data provider has delete/deleteMany methods but not exposed in UI","+- Delete components exist but are NOT accessible to users because:","+  - No edit component exists for apps (apps resource only has `list` and `show`)","+  - No delete buttons in app list actions (only shows ShowButton)","+  - No delete functionality in app details view"," "," ### Key Discoveries:"," - Delete logic in `deleteApp` function is well-designed and can be reused"," - Only ownership check needs to be removed for admin version","-- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern","-- Frontend delete UI components already exist and work","+- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern  ","+- Delete components exist (`DeleteButton`, `BulkDeleteButton`) but need to be exposed in UI","+- Need to add edit component or integrate delete buttons into list/show views"," "," ## Desired End State"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Update the frontend data provider to use the admin endpoint when available.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nUpdate the React Admin data provider to use the admin delete endpoint for app deletions.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin-Specific Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Single app delete works from admin interface\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear\n- [ ] Failed deletes show error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and select an app owned by another user\n3. Click delete button and verify deletion succeeds\n4. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n5. Test bulk delete with multiple apps from different owners\n6. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist\n7. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin endpoint\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":157,"oldLines":14,"newStart":157,"newLines":107,"lines":[" "," ---"," ","-## Phase 2: Frontend Data Provider Update","+## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update"," "," ### Overview","-Update the React Admin data provider to use the admin delete endpoint for app deletions.","+Add UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint."," "," ### Changes Required:"," ","-#### 1.

Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nAdd UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create App Edit Component  \n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit.tsx`\n**Changes**: Create new edit component to expose delete functionality\n\n```typescript\nimport { Edit } from 'react-admin';\nimport { SimpleForm } from '../admin/simple-form';\nimport { AppEditForm } from './app-edit-form';\n\nexport function AppEdit() {\n  return (\n    <Edit>\n      <SimpleForm>\n        <AppEditForm />\n      </SimpleForm>\n    </Edit>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Create App Edit Form\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit-form.tsx` \n**Changes**: Create form component for app editing\n\n```typescript\nimport { TextInput, BooleanInput } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport function AppEditForm() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TextInput source=\"name\" fullWidth />\n      <TextInput source=\"description\" multiline fullWidth />\n      <BooleanInput source=\"isPublic\" />\n      {/* Add other relevant app fields */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Delete Actions to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button\n\n```typescript\n// Update the ActionsCell component\nfunction ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {\n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"row\" spacing={1}>\n      <ShowButton record={record} />\n      <EditButton record={record} />  {/* Add edit button */}\n      <DeleteButton record={record} />  {/* Add delete button */}\n    </Stack>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Add Bulk Delete to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add bulk delete action toolbar\n\n```typescript\nimport { BulkActionsToolbar } from '../admin/bulk-actions-toolbar';\n\nexport function AppList() {\n  return (\n    <List>\n      <DataGrid\n        bulkActionButtons={<BulkActionsToolbar />}\n        // ... existing props\n      >\n        {/* existing columns */}\n      </DataGrid>  \n    </List>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Register Edit Component\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add edit component to apps resource\n\n```typescript\nimport { AppEdit } from './components/apps/app-edit';\n\n// Update the apps Resource\n<Resource\n  name=\"apps\"\n  list={AppList}\n  show={AppShow}\n  edit={AppEdit}  // Add this line\n/>\n```\n\n#### 6. Update Data Provider\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Single app delete works from admin interface\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear\n- [ ] Failed deletes show error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and select an app owned by another user\n3. Click delete button and verify deletion succeeds\n4. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n5. Test bulk delete with multiple apps from different owners\n6. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist\n7. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin endpoint\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":294,"oldLines":15,"newStart":294,"newLines":23,"lines":[" - [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`"," - [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`"," - [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`","+- [ ] No console errors during component rendering"," - [ ] No console errors during delete operations"," "," #### Manual Verification:","-- [ ] Single app delete works from admin interface","+- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column","+- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  ","+- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps","+- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields","+- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works","+- [ ] Single app delete works from app list","+- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page"," - [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps","-- [ ] Success toast notifications appear","-- [ ] Failed deletes show error messages","+- [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete","+- [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages"," - [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete"," - [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly","+- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)"," "," ---"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

This involves creating a new admin-specific delete endpoint and updating the frontend data provider to use it.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Delete Implementation:**\n- User delete endpoint: `DELETE /apps/:id` - restricted to app owner only (`apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts:48`)\n- Admin UI has delete buttons but uses user endpoint (`apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts:504`)\n- Comprehensive external resource cleanup exists (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Sophisticated soft delete with proper logging and error handling\n\n**Authentication Pattern:**\n- Admin routes use: `{ onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] }`\n- Privileged users: `platform_admin`, `staff` roles + Neon employees + Databricks employees\n\n**Admin Frontend:**\n- React Admin framework with existing DeleteButton and BulkDeleteButton components\n- Data provider has delete/deleteMany methods but not exposed in UI\n- Delete components exist but are NOT accessible to users because:\n  - No edit component exists for apps (apps resource only has `list` and `show`)\n  - No delete buttons in app list actions (only shows ShowButton)\n  - No delete functionality in app details view\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- Delete logic in `deleteApp` function is well-designed and can be reused\n- Only ownership check needs to be removed for admin version\n- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern  \n- Delete components exist (`DeleteButton`, `BulkDeleteButton`) but need to be exposed in UI\n- Need to add edit component or integrate delete buttons into list/show views\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation, admin users will be able to:\n1. Delete any app from the admin interface using existing UI buttons\n2. Perform bulk delete operations on multiple apps\n3. Receive proper success/error feedback through existing toast system\n4. Have all external resources properly cleaned up (same as user delete)\n\n### Verification:\n- Admin can delete apps they don't own\n- All external resource cleanup still works correctly\n- Bulk delete operations work for multiple apps\n- Error handling and logging work properly\n- Non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic\n- Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton/BulkDeleteButton exist but aren't exposed)\n- Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access\n- Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nCreate an admin-specific delete endpoint that reuses existing delete logic but removes the ownership restriction. Update the frontend data provider to use the admin endpoint when available.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nAdd UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

This involves creating a new admin-specific delete endpoint and updating the frontend data provider to use it.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Delete Implementation:**\n- User delete endpoint: `DELETE /apps/:id` - restricted to app owner only (`apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts:48`)\n- Admin UI has delete buttons but uses user endpoint (`apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts:504`)\n- Comprehensive external resource cleanup exists (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Sophisticated soft delete with proper logging and error handling\n\n**Authentication Pattern:**\n- Admin routes use: `{ onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] }`\n- Privileged users: `platform_admin`, `staff` roles + Neon employees + Databricks employees\n\n**Admin Frontend:**\n- React Admin framework with existing DeleteButton and BulkDeleteButton components\n- Data provider has delete/deleteMany methods but not exposed in UI\n- Delete components exist but are NOT accessible to users because:\n  - No edit component exists for apps (apps resource only has `list` and `show`)\n  - No delete buttons in app list actions (only shows ShowButton)\n  - No delete functionality in app details view\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- Delete logic in `deleteApp` function is well-designed and can be reused\n- Only ownership check needs to be removed for admin version\n- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern  \n- Delete components exist (`DeleteButton`, `BulkDeleteButton`) but need to be exposed in UI\n- Need to add edit component or integrate delete buttons into list/show views\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation, admin users will be able to:\n1. Delete any app from the admin interface using existing UI buttons\n2. Perform bulk delete operations on multiple apps\n3. Receive proper success/error feedback through existing toast system\n4. Have all external resources properly cleaned up (same as user delete)\n\n### Verification:\n- Admin can delete apps they don't own\n- All external resource cleanup still works correctly\n- Bulk delete operations work for multiple apps\n- Error handling and logging work properly\n- Non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic\n- Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton/BulkDeleteButton exist but aren't exposed)\n- Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access\n- Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nCreate an admin-specific delete endpoint that reuses existing delete logic but removes the ownership restriction. Update the frontend data provider to use the admin endpoint when available.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nAdd UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create App Edit Component  \n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit.tsx`\n**Changes**: Create new edit component to expose delete functionality\n\n```typescript\nimport { Edit } from 'react-admin';\nimport { SimpleForm } from '../admin/simple-form';\nimport { AppEditForm } from './app-edit-form';\n\nexport function AppEdit() {\n  return (\n    <Edit>\n      <SimpleForm>\n        <AppEditForm />\n      </SimpleForm>\n    </Edit>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Create App Edit Form\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit-form.tsx` \n**Changes**: Create form component for app editing\n\n```typescript\nimport { TextInput, BooleanInput } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport function AppEditForm() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TextInput source=\"name\" fullWidth />\n      <TextInput source=\"description\" multiline fullWidth />\n      <BooleanInput source=\"isPublic\" />\n      {/* Add other relevant app fields */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Delete Actions to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button\n\n```typescript\n// Update the ActionsCell component\nfunction ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {\n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"row\" spacing={1}>\n      <ShowButton record={record} />\n      <EditButton record={record} />  {/* Add edit button */}\n      <DeleteButton record={record} />  {/* Add delete button */}\n    </Stack>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Add Bulk Delete to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add bulk delete action toolbar\n\n```typescript\nimport { BulkActionsToolbar } from '../admin/bulk-actions-toolbar';\n\nexport function AppList() {\n  return (\n    <List>\n      <DataGrid\n        bulkActionButtons={<BulkActionsToolbar />}\n        // ... existing props\n      >\n        {/* existing columns */}\n      </DataGrid>  \n    </List>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Register Edit Component\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add edit component to apps resource\n\n```typescript\nimport { AppEdit } from './components/apps/app-edit';\n\n// Update the apps Resource\n<Resource\n  name=\"apps\"\n  list={AppList}\n  show={AppShow}\n  edit={AppEdit}  // Add this line\n/>\n```\n\n#### 6. Update Data Provider\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during component rendering\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column\n- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  \n- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps\n- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields\n- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works\n- [ ] Single app delete works from app list\n- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete\n- [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n#### UI Navigation and Delete via Edit Page:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and verify edit/delete buttons appear in actions\n3. Click edit button on app owned by another user\n4. Verify edit page loads with app details form\n5. Click delete button on edit page and confirm deletion\n6. Verify success toast and redirect to apps list\n\n#### Delete via App List:\n7. From apps list, click delete button directly on an app row\n8. Confirm deletion and verify success feedback\n9. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n\n#### Bulk Delete Operations:\n10. Select multiple apps from different owners using checkboxes\n11. Verify bulk delete toolbar appears\n12. Click bulk delete button and confirm\n13. Verify all selected apps are deleted successfully\n\n#### Error Scenarios:\n14. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist (via direct API)\n15. Test network error scenarios during delete operations\n16. Verify appropriate error messages display to users\n\n#### Security Testing:\n17. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n18. Verify admin UI components only appear for privileged users\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":208,"oldLines":6,"newStart":208,"newLines":9,"lines":[" **Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button"," "," ```typescript","+import { EditButton, ShowButton } from 'react-admin';","+import { DeleteButton } from '../admin/delete-button';","+"," // Update the ActionsCell component"," function ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {","   return ("]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

This involves creating a new admin-specific delete endpoint and updating the frontend data provider to use it.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Delete Implementation:**\n- User delete endpoint: `DELETE /apps/:id` - restricted to app owner only (`apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts:48`)\n- Admin UI has delete buttons but uses user endpoint (`apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts:504`)\n- Comprehensive external resource cleanup exists (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Sophisticated soft delete with proper logging and error handling\n\n**Authentication Pattern:**\n- Admin routes use: `{ onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] }`\n- Privileged users: `platform_admin`, `staff` roles + Neon employees + Databricks employees\n\n**Admin Frontend:**\n- React Admin framework with existing DeleteButton and BulkDeleteButton components\n- Data provider has delete/deleteMany methods but not exposed in UI\n- Delete components exist but are NOT accessible to users because:\n  - No edit component exists for apps (apps resource only has `list` and `show`)\n  - No delete buttons in app list actions (only shows ShowButton)\n  - No delete functionality in app details view\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- Delete logic in `deleteApp` function is well-designed and can be reused\n- Only ownership check needs to be removed for admin version\n- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern  \n- Delete components exist (`DeleteButton`, `BulkDeleteButton`) but need to be exposed in UI\n- Need to add edit component or integrate delete buttons into list/show views\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation, admin users will be able to:\n1. Delete any app from the admin interface using existing UI buttons\n2. Perform bulk delete operations on multiple apps\n3. Receive proper success/error feedback through existing toast system\n4. Have all external resources properly cleaned up (same as user delete)\n\n### Verification:\n- Admin can delete apps they don't own\n- All external resource cleanup still works correctly\n- Bulk delete operations work for multiple apps\n- Error handling and logging work properly\n- Non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic\n- Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton/BulkDeleteButton exist but aren't exposed)\n- Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access\n- Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nCreate an admin-specific delete endpoint that reuses existing delete logic but removes the ownership restriction. Update the frontend data provider to use the admin endpoint when available.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3.

This involves creating a new admin-specific delete endpoint and updating the frontend data provider to use it.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Delete Implementation:**\n- User delete endpoint: `DELETE /apps/:id` - restricted to app owner only (`apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts:48`)\n- Admin UI has delete buttons but uses user endpoint (`apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts:504`)\n- Comprehensive external resource cleanup exists (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Sophisticated soft delete with proper logging and error handling\n\n**Authentication Pattern:**\n- Admin routes use: `{ onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] }`\n- Privileged users: `platform_admin`, `staff` roles + Neon employees + Databricks employees\n\n**Admin Frontend:**\n- React Admin framework with existing DeleteButton and BulkDeleteButton components\n- Data provider has delete/deleteMany methods but not exposed in UI\n- Delete components exist but are NOT accessible to users because:\n  - No edit component exists for apps (apps resource only has `list` and `show`)\n  - No delete buttons in app list actions (only shows ShowButton)\n  - No delete functionality in app details view\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- Delete logic in `deleteApp` function is well-designed and can be reused\n- Only ownership check needs to be removed for admin version\n- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern  \n- Delete components exist (`DeleteButton`, `BulkDeleteButton`) but need to be exposed in UI\n- Need to add edit component or integrate delete buttons into list/show views\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation, admin users will be able to:\n1. Delete any app from the admin interface using delete buttons in the app list\n2. Receive proper success/error feedback through existing toast system\n3. Have all external resources properly cleaned up (same as user delete)\n\n### Verification:\n- Admin can delete apps they don't own from the app list\n- All external resource cleanup still works correctly\n- Error handling and logging work properly\n- Non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic\n- Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton/BulkDeleteButton exist but aren't exposed)\n- Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access\n- Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nCreate an admin-specific delete endpoint that reuses existing delete logic but removes the ownership restriction. Update the frontend data provider to use the admin endpoint when available.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4.

Create App Edit Form\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit-form.tsx` \n**Changes**: Create form component for app editing\n\n```typescript\nimport { TextInput, BooleanInput } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport function AppEditForm() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TextInput source=\"name\" fullWidth />\n      <TextInput source=\"description\" multiline fullWidth />\n      <BooleanInput source=\"isPublic\" />\n      {/* Add other relevant app fields */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Delete Actions to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button\n\n```typescript\nimport { EditButton, ShowButton } from 'react-admin';\nimport { DeleteButton } from '../admin/delete-button';\n\n// Update the ActionsCell component\nfunction ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {\n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"row\" spacing={1}>\n      <ShowButton record={record} />\n      <EditButton record={record} />  {/* Add edit button */}\n      <DeleteButton record={record} />  {/* Add delete button */}\n    </Stack>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Add Bulk Delete to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add bulk delete action toolbar\n\n```typescript\nimport { BulkActionsToolbar } from '../admin/bulk-actions-toolbar';\n\nexport function AppList() {\n  return (\n    <List>\n      <DataGrid\n        bulkActionButtons={<BulkActionsToolbar />}\n        // ... existing props\n      >\n        {/* existing columns */}\n      </DataGrid>  \n    </List>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Register Edit Component\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add edit component to apps resource\n\n```typescript\nimport { AppEdit } from './components/apps/app-edit';\n\n// Update the apps Resource\n<Resource\n  name=\"apps\"\n  list={AppList}\n  show={AppShow}\n  edit={AppEdit}  // Add this line\n/>\n```\n\n#### 6. Update Data Provider\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during component rendering\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column\n- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  \n- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps\n- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields\n- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works\n- [ ] Single app delete works from app list\n- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete\n- [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

Update the frontend data provider to use the admin endpoint when available.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nAdd UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create App Edit Component  \n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit.tsx`\n**Changes**: Create new edit component to expose delete functionality\n\n```typescript\nimport { Edit } from 'react-admin';\nimport { SimpleForm } from '../admin/simple-form';\nimport { AppEditForm } from './app-edit-form';\n\nexport function AppEdit() {\n  return (\n    <Edit>\n      <SimpleForm>\n        <AppEditForm />\n      </SimpleForm>\n    </Edit>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Create App Edit Form\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit-form.tsx` \n**Changes**: Create form component for app editing\n\n```typescript\nimport { TextInput, BooleanInput } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport function AppEditForm() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TextInput source=\"name\" fullWidth />\n      <TextInput source=\"description\" multiline fullWidth />\n      <BooleanInput source=\"isPublic\" />\n      {/* Add other relevant app fields */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Delete Actions to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button\n\n```typescript\nimport { EditButton, ShowButton } from 'react-admin';\nimport { DeleteButton } from '../admin/delete-button';\n\n// Update the ActionsCell component\nfunction ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {\n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"row\" spacing={1}>\n      <ShowButton record={record} />\n      <EditButton record={record} />  {/* Add edit button */}\n      <DeleteButton record={record} />  {/* Add delete button */}\n    </Stack>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Add Bulk Delete to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add bulk delete action toolbar\n\n```typescript\nimport { BulkActionsToolbar } from '../admin/bulk-actions-toolbar';\n\nexport function AppList() {\n  return (\n    <List>\n      <DataGrid\n        bulkActionButtons={<BulkActionsToolbar />}\n        // ... existing props\n      >\n        {/* existing columns */}\n      </DataGrid>  \n    </List>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Register Edit Component\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add edit component to apps resource\n\n```typescript\nimport { AppEdit } from './components/apps/app-edit';\n\n// Update the apps Resource\n<Resource\n  name=\"apps\"\n  list={AppList}\n  show={AppShow}\n  edit={AppEdit}  // Add this line\n/>\n```\n\n#### 6. Update Data Provider\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during component rendering\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column\n- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  \n- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps\n- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields\n- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works\n- [ ] Single app delete works from app list\n- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete\n- [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n#### UI Navigation and Delete via Edit Page:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and verify edit/delete buttons appear in actions\n3. Click edit button on app owned by another user\n4. Verify edit page loads with app details form\n5. Click delete button on edit page and confirm deletion\n6. Verify success toast and redirect to apps list\n\n#### Delete via App List:\n7. From apps list, click delete button directly on an app row\n8. Confirm deletion and verify success feedback\n9. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n\n#### Bulk Delete Operations:\n10. Select multiple apps from different owners using checkboxes\n11. Verify bulk delete toolbar appears\n12. Click bulk delete button and confirm\n13. Verify all selected apps are deleted successfully\n\n#### Error Scenarios:\n14. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist (via direct API)\n15. Test network error scenarios during delete operations\n16. Verify appropriate error messages display to users\n\n#### Security Testing:\n17. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n18. Verify admin UI components only appear for privileged users\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":48,"oldLines":9,"newStart":48,"newLines":12,"lines":[" "," - Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic"," - Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)","-- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton/BulkDeleteButton exist but aren't exposed)","+- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton exists but isn't exposed)","+- Creating edit components or edit functionality for apps","+- Adding bulk delete functionality"," - Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access"," - Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)","+- Adding comprehensive testing (will be handled separately)"," "," ## Implementation Approach"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nAdd UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create App Edit Component  \n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit.tsx`\n**Changes**: Create new edit component to expose delete functionality\n\n```typescript\nimport { Edit } from 'react-admin';\nimport { SimpleForm } from '../admin/simple-form';\nimport { AppEditForm } from './app-edit-form';\n\nexport function AppEdit() {\n  return (\n    <Edit>\n      <SimpleForm>\n        <AppEditForm />\n      </SimpleForm>\n    </Edit>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Create App Edit Form\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit-form.tsx` \n**Changes**: Create form component for app editing\n\n```typescript\nimport { TextInput, BooleanInput } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport function AppEditForm() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TextInput source=\"name\" fullWidth />\n      <TextInput source=\"description\" multiline fullWidth />\n      <BooleanInput source=\"isPublic\" />\n      {/* Add other relevant app fields */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Delete Actions to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button\n\n```typescript\nimport { EditButton, ShowButton } from 'react-admin';\nimport { DeleteButton } from '../admin/delete-button';\n\n// Update the ActionsCell component\nfunction ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {\n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"row\" spacing={1}>\n      <ShowButton record={record} />\n      <EditButton record={record} />  {/* Add edit button */}\n      <DeleteButton record={record} />  {/* Add delete button */}\n    </Stack>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Add Bulk Delete to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add bulk delete action toolbar\n\n```typescript\nimport { BulkActionsToolbar } from '../admin/bulk-actions-toolbar';\n\nexport function AppList() {\n  return (\n    <List>\n      <DataGrid\n        bulkActionButtons={<BulkActionsToolbar />}\n        // ... existing props\n      >\n        {/* existing columns */}\n      </DataGrid>  \n    </List>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Register Edit Component\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add edit component to apps resource\n\n```typescript\nimport { AppEdit } from './components/apps/app-edit';\n\n// Update the apps Resource\n<Resource\n  name=\"apps\"\n  list={AppList}\n  show={AppShow}\n  edit={AppEdit}  // Add this line\n/>\n```\n\n#### 6. Update Data Provider\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during component rendering\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column\n- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  \n- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps\n- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields\n- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works\n- [ ] Single app delete works from app list\n- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete\n- [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n#### UI Navigation and Delete via Edit Page:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and verify edit/delete buttons appear in actions\n3. Click edit button on app owned by another user\n4. Verify edit page loads with app details form\n5. Click delete button on edit page and confirm deletion\n6. Verify success toast and redirect to apps list\n\n#### Delete via App List:\n7. From apps list, click delete button directly on an app row\n8. Confirm deletion and verify success feedback\n9. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n\n#### Bulk Delete Operations:\n10. Select multiple apps from different owners using checkboxes\n11. Verify bulk delete toolbar appears\n12. Click bulk delete button and confirm\n13. Verify all selected apps are deleted successfully\n\n#### Error Scenarios:\n14. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist (via direct API)\n15. Test network error scenarios during delete operations\n16. Verify appropriate error messages display to users\n\n#### Security Testing:\n17. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n18. Verify admin UI components only appear for privileged users\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":57,"oldLines":7,"newStart":57,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## Implementation Approach"," ","-Create an admin-specific delete endpoint that reuses existing delete logic but removes the ownership restriction.

This involves creating a new admin-specific delete endpoint and updating the frontend data provider to use it.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Delete Implementation:**\n- User delete endpoint: `DELETE /apps/:id` - restricted to app owner only (`apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts:48`)\n- Admin UI has delete buttons but uses user endpoint (`apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts:504`)\n- Comprehensive external resource cleanup exists (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Sophisticated soft delete with proper logging and error handling\n\n**Authentication Pattern:**\n- Admin routes use: `{ onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] }`\n- Privileged users: `platform_admin`, `staff` roles + Neon employees + Databricks employees\n\n**Admin Frontend:**\n- React Admin framework with existing DeleteButton and BulkDeleteButton components\n- Data provider has delete/deleteMany methods but not exposed in UI\n- Delete components exist but are NOT accessible to users because:\n  - No edit component exists for apps (apps resource only has `list` and `show`)\n  - No delete buttons in app list actions (only shows ShowButton)\n  - No delete functionality in app details view\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- Delete logic in `deleteApp` function is well-designed and can be reused\n- Only ownership check needs to be removed for admin version\n- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern  \n- Delete components exist (`DeleteButton`) but need to be exposed in UI\n- Need to integrate delete buttons into list view actions\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation, admin users will be able to:\n1. Delete any app from the admin interface using delete buttons in the app list\n2. Receive proper success/error feedback through existing toast system\n3. Have all external resources properly cleaned up (same as user delete)\n\n### Verification:\n- Admin can delete apps they don't own from the app list\n- All external resource cleanup still works correctly\n- Error handling and logging work properly\n- Non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic\n- Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton exists but isn't exposed)\n- Creating edit components or edit functionality for apps\n- Adding bulk delete functionality\n- Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access\n- Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)\n- Adding comprehensive testing (will be handled separately)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nCreate an admin-specific delete endpoint that reuses existing delete logic but removes the ownership restriction. Add delete buttons to the app list actions and update the data provider to use the admin endpoint.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nAdd UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Create App Edit Component  \n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit.tsx`\n**Changes**: Create new edit component to expose delete functionality\n\n```typescript\nimport { Edit } from 'react-admin';\nimport { SimpleForm } from '../admin/simple-form';\nimport { AppEditForm } from './app-edit-form';\n\nexport function AppEdit() {\n  return (\n    <Edit>\n      <SimpleForm>\n        <AppEditForm />\n      </SimpleForm>\n    </Edit>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Create App Edit Form\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/app-edit-form.tsx` \n**Changes**: Create form component for app editing\n\n```typescript\nimport { TextInput, BooleanInput } from 'react-admin';\n\nexport function AppEditForm() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TextInput source=\"name\" fullWidth />\n      <TextInput source=\"description\" multiline fullWidth />\n      <BooleanInput source=\"isPublic\" />\n      {/* Add other relevant app fields */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Add Delete Actions to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button\n\n```typescript\nimport { EditButton, ShowButton } from 'react-admin';\nimport { DeleteButton } from '../admin/delete-button';\n\n// Update the ActionsCell component\nfunction ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {\n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"row\" spacing={1}>\n      <ShowButton record={record} />\n      <EditButton record={record} />  {/* Add edit button */}\n      <DeleteButton record={record} />  {/* Add delete button */}\n    </Stack>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Add Bulk Delete to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add bulk delete action toolbar\n\n```typescript\nimport { BulkActionsToolbar } from '../admin/bulk-actions-toolbar';\n\nexport function AppList() {\n  return (\n    <List>\n      <DataGrid\n        bulkActionButtons={<BulkActionsToolbar />}\n        // ... existing props\n      >\n        {/* existing columns */}\n      </DataGrid>  \n    </List>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. Register Edit Component\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Add edit component to apps resource\n\n```typescript\nimport { AppEdit } from './components/apps/app-edit';\n\n// Update the apps Resource\n<Resource\n  name=\"apps\"\n  list={AppList}\n  show={AppShow}\n  edit={AppEdit}  // Add this line\n/>\n```\n\n#### 6. Update Data Provider\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete methods to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  deleteMany: async (params: DeleteManyParams): Promise<DeleteManyResult> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint for bulk delete\n    await Promise.all(\n      params.ids.map((id) => apiClient.delete(`/admin/apps/${id}`)),\n    );\n\n    return {\n      data: params.ids,\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during component rendering\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column\n- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  \n- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps\n- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields\n- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works\n- [ ] Single app delete works from app list\n- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete\n- [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n#### UI Navigation and Delete via Edit Page:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and verify edit/delete buttons appear in actions\n3. Click edit button on app owned by another user\n4. Verify edit page loads with app details form\n5. Click delete button on edit page and confirm deletion\n6. Verify success toast and redirect to apps list\n\n#### Delete via App List:\n7. From apps list, click delete button directly on an app row\n8. Confirm deletion and verify success feedback\n9. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n\n#### Bulk Delete Operations:\n10. Select multiple apps from different owners using checkboxes\n11. Verify bulk delete toolbar appears\n12. Click bulk delete button and confirm\n13. Verify all selected apps are deleted successfully\n\n#### Error Scenarios:\n14. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist (via direct API)\n15. Test network error scenarios during delete operations\n16. Verify appropriate error messages display to users\n\n#### Security Testing:\n17. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n18. Verify admin UI components only appear for privileged users\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":161,"oldLines":55,"newStart":161,"newLines":16,"lines":[" ## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update"," "," ### Overview","-Add UI components to expose delete functionality and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.","+Add delete button to app list actions and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint."," "," ### Changes Required:"," ","-#### 1.

This involves creating a new admin-specific delete endpoint and updating the frontend data provider to use it.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Existing Delete Implementation:**\n- User delete endpoint: `DELETE /apps/:id` - restricted to app owner only (`apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts:48`)\n- Admin UI has delete buttons but uses user endpoint (`apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts:504`)\n- Comprehensive external resource cleanup exists (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Sophisticated soft delete with proper logging and error handling\n\n**Authentication Pattern:**\n- Admin routes use: `{ onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] }`\n- Privileged users: `platform_admin`, `staff` roles + Neon employees + Databricks employees\n\n**Admin Frontend:**\n- React Admin framework with existing DeleteButton and BulkDeleteButton components\n- Data provider has delete/deleteMany methods but not exposed in UI\n- Delete components exist but are NOT accessible to users because:\n  - No edit component exists for apps (apps resource only has `list` and `show`)\n  - No delete buttons in app list actions (only shows ShowButton)\n  - No delete functionality in app details view\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- Delete logic in `deleteApp` function is well-designed and can be reused\n- Only ownership check needs to be removed for admin version\n- Admin already has proper authentication middleware pattern  \n- Delete components exist (`DeleteButton`) but need to be exposed in UI\n- Need to integrate delete buttons into list view actions\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation, admin users will be able to:\n1. Delete any app from the admin interface using delete buttons in the app list\n2. Receive proper success/error feedback through existing toast system\n3. Have all external resources properly cleaned up (same as user delete)\n\n### Verification:\n- Admin can delete apps they don't own from the app list\n- All external resource cleanup still works correctly\n- Error handling and logging work properly\n- Non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Modifying the existing user delete endpoint or its business logic\n- Changing the external resource cleanup logic (Koyeb, Neon, ECR, GitHub, Databricks)\n- Creating new delete button components (DeleteButton exists but isn't exposed)\n- Creating edit components or edit functionality for apps\n- Adding bulk delete functionality\n- Modifying authentication/authorization logic for admin access\n- Adding restore functionality (exists but not needed for this task)\n- Adding comprehensive testing (will be handled separately)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nCreate an admin-specific delete endpoint that reuses existing delete logic but removes the ownership restriction. Add delete buttons to the app list actions and update the data provider to use the admin endpoint.\n\n## Phase 1: Backend Admin Delete Endpoint\n\n### Overview\nCreate a new admin delete endpoint that allows privileged users to delete any app.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Admin Apps Module\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/admin/apps.ts`\n**Changes**: Add new `deleteAppForAdmin` function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteAppForAdmin(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  const { id } = request.params as { id: string };\n\n  if (!validate(id)) {\n    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid app ID' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    const app = await db\n      .select({\n        id: apps.id,\n        name: apps.name,\n        ownerId: apps.ownerId,\n        // ... all other fields same as user delete\n      })\n      .from(apps)\n      .where(eq(apps.id, id)); // Remove ownership check\n\n    if (!app || app.length === 0) {\n      return reply.status(404).send({\n        error: 'App not found',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // Use existing delete logic from deleteApp function\n    // Extract shared logic to avoid duplication\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Same error handling as user delete\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Shared Delete Logic\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app-shared.ts`\n**Changes**: Extract reusable delete logic from existing deleteApp function\n\n```typescript\nexport async function executeAppDeletion(\n  appId: string,\n  ownerId: string,\n  appData: AppData,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Move all deletion logic here from deleteApp function\n  // This allows both user and admin endpoints to use same logic\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Route Registration\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Add admin delete route\n\n```typescript\napp.delete(\n  '/admin/apps/:id',\n  { onRequest: [app.authenticate, requirePrivilegedUser] },\n  deleteAppForAdmin,\n);\n```\n\n#### 4. Export New Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/index.ts`\n**Changes**: Export the new admin delete function\n\n```typescript\nexport { deleteAppForAdmin } from './admin/apps';\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [x] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 404 for non-existent apps\n- [ ] New endpoint returns 403 for non-privileged users\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin can delete any app via `DELETE /admin/apps/:id`\n- [ ] External resource cleanup works correctly\n- [ ] Logging shows proper admin context\n- [ ] Error handling works for various failure scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Frontend UI and Data Provider Update\n\n### Overview\nAdd delete button to app list actions and update the data provider to use the admin delete endpoint.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Add Delete Button to App List\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/components/apps/apps-list.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update ActionsCell to include delete button\n\n```typescript\nimport { ShowButton } from 'react-admin';\nimport { DeleteButton } from '../admin/delete-button';\n\n// Update the ActionsCell component\nfunction ActionsCell({ record }: { record: AppRecord }) {\n  return (\n    <Stack direction=\"row\" spacing={1}>\n      <ShowButton record={record} />\n      <DeleteButton record={record} />  {/* Add delete button */}\n    </Stack>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Update Data Provider\n**File**: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n**Changes**: Update apps resource delete method to use admin endpoint\n\n```typescript\napps: {\n  // ... existing methods\n\n  delete: async (params: DeleteParams): Promise<DeleteResult<AppRecord>> => {\n    // Use admin endpoint instead of user endpoint\n    const response = await apiClient.delete<App>(`/admin/apps/${params.id}`);\n    return {\n      data: convertAppToRecord(response.data),\n    };\n  },\n\n  // ... rest of methods (keep existing deleteMany, restore, etc.)\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`\n- [ ] No console errors during component rendering\n- [ ] No console errors during delete operations\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column\n- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  \n- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps\n- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields\n- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works\n- [ ] Single app delete works from app list\n- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page\n- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps\n- [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete\n- [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages\n- [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete\n- [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly\n- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Integration Testing & Cleanup\n\n### Overview\nTest the complete end-to-end functionality and ensure proper error handling.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Refactor Original Delete Function\n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] All backend tests pass: `bun test`\n- [ ] All frontend tests pass: `cd apps/admin && bun test`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass with admin delete scenarios\n- [ ] No TypeScript or linting errors\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 when trying admin endpoint\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully\n- [ ] UI feedback is appropriate for success and failure cases\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- Test admin delete endpoint with various app states\n- Test ownership validation bypass for admin endpoint\n- Test error handling for invalid app IDs\n- Test authentication failures\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- End-to-end delete flow from admin UI\n- External resource cleanup verification\n- Bulk delete operations\n- Error scenarios and recovery\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n\n#### UI Navigation and Delete via Edit Page:\n1. Login as admin user in admin interface\n2. Navigate to apps list and verify edit/delete buttons appear in actions\n3. Click edit button on app owned by another user\n4. Verify edit page loads with app details form\n5. Click delete button on edit page and confirm deletion\n6. Verify success toast and redirect to apps list\n\n#### Delete via App List:\n7. From apps list, click delete button directly on an app row\n8. Confirm deletion and verify success feedback\n9. Check that external resources are cleaned up properly\n\n#### Bulk Delete Operations:\n10. Select multiple apps from different owners using checkboxes\n11. Verify bulk delete toolbar appears\n12. Click bulk delete button and confirm\n13. Verify all selected apps are deleted successfully\n\n#### Error Scenarios:\n14. Verify error handling for apps that don't exist (via direct API)\n15. Test network error scenarios during delete operations\n16. Verify appropriate error messages display to users\n\n#### Security Testing:\n17. Test that non-admin users cannot access the admin delete endpoint\n18. Verify admin UI components only appear for privileged users\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":210,"oldLines":23,"newStart":210,"newLines":15,"lines":[" - [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`"," - [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`"," - [ ] Admin frontend builds successfully: `bun dev`","-- [ ] No console errors during component rendering"," - [ ] No console errors during delete operations"," "," #### Manual Verification:","-- [ ] Edit button appears in app list actions column","-- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column  ","-- [ ] Bulk delete toolbar appears when selecting multiple apps","-- [ ] Edit page loads correctly with app form fields","-- [ ] Delete button appears on edit page and works","-- [ ] Single app delete works from app list","-- [ ] Single app delete works from edit page","-- [ ] Bulk delete works for multiple selected apps","+- [ ] Delete button appears in app list actions column","+- [ ] Delete button works when clicked from app list"," - [ ] Success toast notifications appear after delete"," - [ ] Failed deletes show appropriate error messages"," - [ ] App list refreshes after successful delete"," - [ ] Undoable delete functionality works correctly","-- [ ] Edit navigation works (list → edit → back to list)"," "," ---"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Refactor Original Delete Function  \n**File**: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n**Changes**: Update to use shared delete logic\n\n```typescript\nexport async function deleteApp(\n  request: FastifyRequest,\n  reply: FastifyReply,\n): Promise<void> {\n  // Keep ownership check for user endpoint\n  const app = await db\n    .select({...})\n    .from(apps)\n    .where(and(eq(apps.id, id), eq(apps.ownerId, user.id))); // Keep this check\n\n  // Use shared executeAppDeletion function\n  await executeAppDeletion(id, user.id, appData);\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] Backend starts without errors: `bun dev`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Admin delete works for apps owned by different users\n- [ ] User delete still works and only allows own apps\n- [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up\n- [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications. The external resource cleanup is already optimized with proper error handling and async operations where appropriate.\n\n## Migration Notes\n\nNo data migration required - this is purely additive functionality that adds a new endpoint and updates frontend behavior.\n\n## References\n\n- Original user delete implementation: `apps/backend/src/apps/delete-app.ts`\n- Admin authentication pattern: `apps/backend/src/middleware/neon-employee-auth.ts`\n- React Admin data provider: `apps/admin/src/lib/react-admin/data-provider.ts`\n- Admin delete components: `apps/admin/src/components/admin/delete-button.tsx`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":262,"oldLines":17,"newStart":262,"newLines":10,"lines":[" - [ ] All external resources are properly cleaned up"," - [ ] Logging includes proper context for admin vs user deletes"," ","-## Performance Considerations","-","-The admin delete functionality reuses all existing delete logic, so there are no additional performance implications.
