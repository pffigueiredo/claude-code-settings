Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n    10→```\n    11→\n    12→Then wait for the user's research query.\n    13→\n    14→## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n    15→\n    16→1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n    17→   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n    18→   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n    19→   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n    20→   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n    21→\n    22→2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n    23→   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n    24→   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n    25→   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n    26→   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n    27→   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n    28→\n    29→3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n    30→   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n    31→   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n    32→\n    33→   **For codebase research:**\n    34→   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n    35→   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works\n    36→   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent if you need examples of similar implementations\n    37→\n    38→   **For thoughts directory:**\n    39→   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n    40→   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n    41→\n    42→   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n    43→   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n    44→   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n    45→\n    46→   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n    47→   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n    48→   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings\n    49→   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n    50→   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n    51→   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n    52→\n    53→4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n    54→   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n    55→   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n    56→   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n    57→   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n    58→   - Connect findings across different components\n    59→   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n    60→   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n    61→   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n    62→   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n    63→\n    64→5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n    65→   - Run the `hack/spec-metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n    66→   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`\n    67→\n    68→6. **Generate research document:**\n    69→   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n    70→   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n    71→     ```markdown\n    72→     ---\n    73→     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n    74→     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n    75→     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n    76→     branch: [Current branch name]\n    77→     repository: [Repository name]\n    78→     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n    79→     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n    80→     status: complete\n    81→     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n    82→     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n    83→     ---\n    84→\n    85→     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n    86→\n    87→     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n    88→     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n    89→     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n    90→     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n    91→     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n    92→\n    93→     ## Research Question\n    94→     [Original user query]\n    95→\n    96→     ## Summary\n    97→     [High-level findings answering the user's question]\n    98→\n    99→     ## Detailed Findings\n   100→\n   101→     ### [Component/Area 1]\n   102→     -

Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent if you need examples of similar implementations\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec-metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level findings answering the user's question]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     -

Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Collect and synchronize all latest files and updates from the thoughts directory, then feed their contents into the LLM context to ensure accurate, up-to-date synthesis.\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research -

You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-agent** agent to analyze the current UI implementation and patterns\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1.

This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Include Design Review Checkpoints**:\n   - For any phase involving UI changes (.tsx, .css files in apps/web or apps/admin)\n   - Add \"Design Review Checkpoint\" section to Success Criteria\n   - Ensure blockers and high-priority issues must be addressed before proceeding\n   - Document medium-priority issues for follow-up\n\n4. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n5. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n6. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n7. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks.

Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by exploring relevant components and connections.\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's research query.\n\n## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:\n\n1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**\n   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks\n   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research\n\n2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**\n   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas\n   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking\n   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate\n   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks\n   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:\n\n   **For codebase research:**\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works\n   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent if you need examples of similar implementations\n\n   **For thoughts directory:**\n   - Use the **thoughts-locator** agent to discover what documents exist about the topic\n   - Use the **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key insights from specific documents (only the most relevant ones)\n\n   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**\n   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources\n   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report\n\n   The key is to use these agents intelligently:\n   - Start with locator agents to find what exists\n   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings\n   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things\n   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for\n   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know\n\n4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**\n   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding\n   - Compile all sub-agent results (both codebase and thoughts findings)\n   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth\n   - Use thoughts/ findings as supplementary historical context\n   - Connect findings across different components\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference\n   - Verify all thoughts/ paths are correct (e.g., thoughts/allison/ not thoughts/shared/ for personal files)\n   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions\n   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence\n\n5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**\n   - Run the `hack/spec-metadata.sh` script to generate all relevant metadata\n   - Filename: `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`\n\n6. **Generate research document:**\n   - Use the metadata gathered in step 4\n   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:\n     ```markdown\n     ---\n     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]\n     researcher: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     git_commit: [Current commit hash]\n     branch: [Current branch name]\n     repository: [Repository name]\n     topic: \"[User's Question/Topic]\"\n     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]\n     status: complete\n     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]\n     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]\n     ---\n\n     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]\n\n     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 4]\n     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from thoughts status]\n     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 4]\n     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 4]\n     **Repository**: [Repository name]\n\n     ## Research Question\n     [Original user query]\n\n     ## Summary\n     [High-level findings answering the user's question]\n\n     ## Detailed Findings\n\n     ### [Component/Area 1]\n     - Finding with reference ([file.ext:line](link))\n     - Connection to other components\n     - Implementation details\n\n     ### [Component/Area 2]\n     ...\n\n     ## Code References\n     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there\n     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block\n\n     ## Architecture Insights\n     [Patterns, conventions, and design decisions discovered]\n\n     ## Historical Context (from thoughts/)\n     [Relevant insights from thoughts/ directory with references]\n     - `thoughts/shared/something.md` - Historical decision about X\n     - `thoughts/local/notes.md` - Past exploration of Y\n     Note: Paths exclude \"searchable/\" even if found there\n\n     ## Related Research\n     [Links to other research documents in thoughts/shared/research/]\n\n     ## Open Questions\n     [Any areas that need further investigation]\n     ```\n\n7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**\n   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`\n   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:\n     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`\n     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`\n   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document\n\n8. **Sync and present findings:**\n   - Collect and synchronize all latest files and updates from the thoughts directory, then feed their contents into the LLM context to ensure accurate, up-to-date synthesis.\n   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user\n   - Include key file references for easy navigation\n   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification\n\n9. **Handle follow-up questions:**\n   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document\n   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update\n   - Add `last_updated_note: \"Added follow-up research for [brief description]\"` to frontmatter\n   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`\n   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation\n   - Continue updating the document and syncing\n\n## Important notes:\n- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage\n- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents\n- The thoughts/ directory provides historical context to supplement live findings\n- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference\n- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context\n- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only operations\n- Consider cross-component connections and architectural patterns\n- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)\n- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references\n- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading\n- Encourage sub-agents to find examples and usage patterns, not just definitions\n- Explore all of thoughts/ directory, not just research subdirectory\n- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks\n- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly\n  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)\n  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)\n  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)\n  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values\n- **Path handling**: The thoughts/searchable/ directory contains hard links for searching\n  - Always document paths by removing ONLY \"searchable/\" - preserve all other subdirectories\n  - Examples of correct transformations:\n    - `thoughts/searchable/allison/old_stuff/notes.md` → `thoughts/allison/old_stuff/notes.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/shared/prs/123.md` → `thoughts/shared/prs/123.md`\n    - `thoughts/searchable/global/shared/templates.md` → `thoughts/global/shared/templates.md`\n  - NEVER change allison/ to shared/ or vice versa - preserve the exact directory structure\n  - This ensures paths are correct for editing and navigation\n- **Frontmatter consistency**:\n  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents\n  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents\n  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research\n  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)\n  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":3,"newStart":1,"newLines":8,"lines":["+---","+description: Research the codebase comprehensively to answer questions","+argument-hint: [research-query]","+---","+"," # Research Codebase"," "," You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings."]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n   - If UI changes are required, use the **ui-agent** agent to analyze the current UI implementation and patterns\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n5. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Design Review Checkpoint (if UI changes):\n- [ ] Run `/design-review` after implementation\n- [ ] Address all [Blocker] issues found in review\n- [ ] Address all [High-Priority] issues found in review\n- [ ] Document [Medium-Priority] issues for follow-up\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Include Design Review Checkpoints**:\n   - For any phase involving UI changes (.tsx, .css files in apps/web or apps/admin)\n   - Add \"Design Review Checkpoint\" section to Success Criteria\n   - Ensure blockers and high-priority issues must be addressed before proceeding\n   - Document medium-priority issues for follow-up\n\n4. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n5. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n6. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n7. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":3,"newStart":1,"newLines":8,"lines":["+---","+description: Create detailed implementation plans through interactive process","+argument-hint: [ticket-path]","+---","+"," # Implementation Plan"," "," You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process.

Count UI vs non-UI files changed\n2. If zero UI files changed, respond: \"No UI changes detected. Skipping design review.\"\n3. If UI files found, proceed with analysis\n4. Provide summary: \"Found UI changes in X components affecting Y areas\"\n\n# Phase 2: URL Discovery and Route Mapping\n\n## Step 3: Detect Affected URLs\n\n**For each changed UI file, determine what URLs need reviewing:**\n\n**Route Detection Strategy:**\n1. **Direct Route Files**: Check if changed files are in `pages/` or `app/` directories\n2. **Component Usage**: For components, find which pages import them\n3. **Layout Changes**: Check if layout components affect multiple routes\n\n**URL Mapping Examples:**\n- `apps/web/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` → `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`\n- `apps/admin/src/pages/users.tsx` → `http://localhost:3001/users`\n- `packages/design/components/Button.tsx` → Find all pages that use Button\n\n**Build Review Plan:**\n- List all affected URLs\n- Prioritize by impact (direct changes vs indirect usage)\n- Ask user to confirm or specify additional URLs\n\n# Phase 3: Development Server Verification\n\n## Step 4: Server Health Check\n\n**PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS:**\n\n```bash\n# Check if web dev server is running\n!`curl -s http://localhost:5173 >/dev/null && echo \"Web server: RUNNING\" || echo \"Web server: NOT RUNNING\"`\n```\n\n```bash\n# Check if admin dev server is running  \n!`curl -s http://localhost:3001 >/dev/null && echo \"Admin server: RUNNING\" || echo \"Admin server: NOT RUNNING\"`\n```\n\n**If servers not running:**\n1. Inform user: \"Development servers not detected\"\n2. Provide instructions: \"Please start servers with `bun dev` before continuing\"\n3. Wait for user confirmation or offer to help start them\n\n**TypeScript/Lint Check:**\n```bash\n!`bun types:check 2>&1 | head -20`\n```\n\nIf compilation errors found, warn user and ask if they want to continue anyway.\n\n# Phase 4: Execute Comprehensive Review\n\n## Step 5: Launch UI Agent Review\n\nUse the Task tool to spawn the ui-agent with comprehensive review instructions:\n\n**REVIEW MODE INSTRUCTIONS FOR UI-AGENT:**\n- **Primary Focus**: Review the specific URLs identified in Phase 2\n- **Testing Scope**: \n  - Visual consistency with existing design system\n  - Responsive behavior (1440px, 768px, 375px viewports)\n  - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)\n  - Keyboard navigation and focus management\n  - Interactive states (hover, active, disabled, loading)\n  - Form validation and error handling\n  - Console error monitoring\n  - Performance and loading behavior\n\n**URLs to Review**: [Pass the detected URLs from Phase 2]\n\n**Expected Output**: Structured markdown report with:\n- Executive summary\n- Categorized findings (Blocker/High-Priority/Medium-Priority/Nitpicks)\n- Screenshots for visual issues\n- Specific recommendations with file:line references where applicable\n\n# Phase 5: Persistent Review Documentation\n\n## Step 6: Save Review Results\n\n**Generate Review Document:**\n1. Create timestamp-based filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-{branch-name}-review.md`\n2. Save to `thoughts/shared/reviews/`\n3. Include:\n   - Review metadata (date, branch, reviewer, files changed)\n   - Complete findings from ui-agent\n   - Screenshots and evidence\n   - Resolution tracking checkboxes\n   - Link to related implementation plans\n\n**Review Document Template:**\n```markdown\n# Design Review: {Branch Name}\n\n**Date**: {timestamp}\n**Branch**: {current-branch}  \n**Files Changed**: {count} UI files\n**URLs Reviewed**: {detected-urls}\n\n## Summary\n{ui-agent-summary}\n\n## Files Changed\n{list-of-changed-ui-files}\n\n## Review Findings\n\n### Blockers 🚫\n- [ ] {finding-with-screenshot}\n\n### High-Priority ⚠️  \n- [ ] {finding-with-screenshot}\n\n### Medium-Priority 📝\n- [ ] {finding}\n\n### Nitpicks ✨\n- [ ] {finding}\n\n## Screenshots\n{embedded-screenshots}\n\n## Follow-up Actions\n- [ ] Address blockers before merge\n- [ ] File issues for medium-priority items\n- [ ] Update design system if patterns found\n\n## Related Links\n- Implementation Plan: {link-if-available}\n- PR: {pr-link-if-available}\n```\n\n# Phase 6: Present Results\n\n## Step 7: Actionable Summary\n\nPresent the review results to the user with:\n\n1. **Quick Summary**: \"Found X blockers, Y high-priority issues in Z components\"\n2. **Critical Path**: List must-fix items before merge\n3. **File Location**: \"Full review saved to `thoughts/shared/reviews/{filename}.md`\"\n4. **Next Steps**: Recommend immediate actions\n\n**Response Format:**\n```\n## Design Review Complete ✅\n\n**Quick Summary**: Found {blocker-count} blockers, {high-priority-count} high-priority issues\n\n**Must Fix Before Merge**:\n- {blocker-1}\n- {blocker-2}\n\n**Review Details**: `thoughts/shared/reviews/{filename}.md`\n\n**Next Steps**:\n1. Address blockers listed above\n2. Consider high-priority issues for this release\n3. Run `/design-review` again after fixes to verify\n```\n\n# Smart Features\n\n## Conditional Logic\n- **Skip non-UI changes**: Exit early if no UI files changed\n- **Adaptive URL detection**: Smart mapping based on file types and usage\n- **Server-aware**: Only proceed when development environment is ready\n- **Error resilient**: Handle compilation errors gracefully\n\n## User Interaction\n- Confirm detected URLs before review\n- Allow user to specify additional routes\n- Ask about review depth (quick vs comprehensive)\n- Provide clear next steps based on findings\n\n## Performance Optimized\n- Only review changed components and their dependents\n- Cache results to avoid re-reviewing unchanged areas\n- Batch screenshots and testing for efficiency\n- Focus testing on most likely problem areas\n\nThis enhanced design review process transforms a simple diff review into an intelligent, context-aware system that knows what to test, ensures the environment is ready, and provides persistent, actionable results.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":6,"newStart":1,"newLines":6,"lines":[" ---","-allowed-tools: Grep, LS, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, BashOutput, KillBash, ListMcpResourcesTool, ReadMcpResourceTool, mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__context7__get-library-docs, mcp__playwright__browser_close, mcp__playwright__browser_resize, mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages, mcp__playwright__browser_handle_dialog, mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate, mcp__playwright__browser_file_upload, mcp__playwright__browser_install, mcp__playwright__browser_press_key, mcp__playwright__browser_type, mcp__playwright__browser_navigate, mcp__playwright__browser_navigate_back, mcp__playwright__browser_navigate_forward, mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests, mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot, mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot, mcp__playwright__browser_click, mcp__playwright__browser_drag, mcp__playwright__browser_hover, mcp__playwright__browser_select_option, mcp__playwright__browser_tab_list, mcp__playwright__browser_tab_new, mcp__playwright__browser_tab_select, mcp__playwright__browser_tab_close, mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for, Bash, Glob, Task"," description: Complete an intelligent design review of UI changes on the current branch with smart filtering, URL detection, and persistent results","+argument-hint: [branch-name]"," ---"," "," You are an intelligent design review orchestrator that conducts comprehensive UI reviews with context awareness and smart automation."]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
