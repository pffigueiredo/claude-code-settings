You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.\n\n## Initial Response\n\nWhen this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Check if parameters were provided**:\n   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message\n   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY\n   - Begin the research process\n\n2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:\n```\nI'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)\n2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements\n3. Links to related research or previous implementations\n\nI'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.\n\nTip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/create_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\nFor deeper analysis, try: `/create_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`\n```\n\nThen wait for the user's input.\n\n## Process Steps\n\n### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis\n\n1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:\n   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)\n   - Research documents\n   - Related implementation plans\n   - Any JSON/data files mentioned\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files\n   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context\n   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely\n\n2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:\n   Before asking the user any questions, use specialized agents to research in parallel:\n\n   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find all files related to the ticket/task\n   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand how the current implementation works\n   - If relevant, use the **thoughts-locator** agent to find any existing thoughts documents about this feature\n\n   These agents will:\n   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests\n   - Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, they'll focus on humanlayer-wui/)\n   - Trace data flow and key functions\n   - Return detailed explanations with file:line references\n\n3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:\n   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant\n   - Read them FULLY into the main context\n   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding\n\n4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:\n   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings\n   - Note assumptions that need verification\n   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality\n\n5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:\n   ```\n   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].\n\n   I've found that:\n   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]\n   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]\n   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]\n\n   Questions that my research couldn't answer:\n   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]\n   - [Business logic clarification]\n   - [Design preference that affects implementation]\n   ```\n\n   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.\n\n### Step 2: Research & Discovery\n\nAfter getting initial clarifications:\n\n1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:\n   - DO NOT just accept the correction\n   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information\n   - Read the specific files/directories they mention\n   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself\n\n2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks\n\n3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:\n   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently\n   - Use the right agent for each type of research:\n\n   **For deeper investigation:**\n   - **codebase-locator** - To find more specific files (e.g., \"find all files that handle [specific component]\")\n   - **codebase-analyzer** - To understand implementation details (e.g., \"analyze how [system] works\")\n   - **codebase-pattern-finder** - To find similar features we can model after\n\n   **For historical context:**\n   - **thoughts-locator** - To find any research, plans, or decisions about this area\n   - **thoughts-analyzer** - To extract key insights from the most relevant documents\n\n   Each agent knows how to:\n   - Find the right files and code patterns\n   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow\n   - Look for integration points and dependencies\n   - Return specific file:line references\n   - Find tests and examples\n\n3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding\n\n4. **Present findings and design options**:\n   ```\n   Based on my research, here's what I found:\n\n   **Current State:**\n   - [Key discovery about existing code]\n   - [Pattern or convention to follow]\n\n   **Design Options:**\n   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]\n   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]\n\n   **Open Questions:**\n   - [Technical uncertainty]\n   - [Design decision needed]\n\n   Which approach aligns best with your vision?\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Plan Structure Development\n\nOnce aligned on approach:\n\n1. **Create initial plan outline**:\n   ```\n   Here's my proposed plan structure:\n\n   ## Overview\n   [1-2 sentence summary]\n\n   ## Implementation Phases:\n   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]\n\n   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?\n   ```\n\n2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing\n\nAfter structure approval:\n\n1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`\n2. **Use this template structure**:\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan\n\n## Overview\n\n[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]\n\n## Desired End State\n\n[A Specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- [Important finding with file:line reference]\n- [Pattern to follow]\n- [Constraint to work within]\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n[High-level strategy and reasoning]\n\n## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]\n\n### Overview\n[What this phase accomplishes]\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. [Component/File Group]\n**File**: `path/to/file.ext`\n**Changes**: [Summary of changes]\n\n```[language]\n// Specific code to add/modify\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Migration applies cleanly: `make migrate`\n- [ ] Unit tests pass: `make test-component`\n- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`\n- [ ] Integration tests pass: `make test-integration`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load\n- [ ] Edge case handling verified manually\n- [ ] No regressions in related features\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]\n\n[Similar structure with both automated and manual success criteria...]\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- [What to test]\n- [Key edge cases]\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- [End-to-end scenarios]\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. [Specific step to verify feature]\n2. [Another verification step]\n3. [Edge case to test manually]\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n[Any performance implications or optimizations needed]\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n[If applicable, how to handle existing data/systems]\n\n## References\n\n- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`\n- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`\n- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`\n```\n\n### Step 5: Sync and Review\n\n1. **Sync the thoughts directory**:\n   - Run `humanlayer thoughts sync` to sync the newly created plan\n   - This ensures the plan is properly indexed and available\n\n2. **Present the draft plan location**:\n   ```\n   I've created the initial implementation plan at:\n   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`\n\n   Please review it and let me know:\n   - Are the phases properly scoped?\n   - Are the success criteria specific enough?\n   - Any technical details that need adjustment?\n   - Missing edge cases or considerations?\n   ```\n\n3. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:\n   - Add missing phases\n   - Adjust technical approach\n   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)\n   - Add/remove scope items\n\n4. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Be Skeptical**:\n   - Question vague requirements\n   - Identify potential issues early\n   - Ask \"why\" and \"what about\"\n   - Don't assume - verify with code\n\n2. **Be Interactive**:\n   - Don't write the full plan in one shot\n   - Get buy-in at each major step\n   - Allow course corrections\n   - Work collaboratively\n\n3. **Be Thorough**:\n   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning\n   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks\n   - Include specific file paths and line numbers\n   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction\n\n4. **Be Practical**:\n   - Focus on incremental, testable changes\n   - Consider migration and rollback\n   - Think about edge cases\n   - Include \"what we're NOT doing\"\n\n5. **Track Progress**:\n   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks\n   - Update todos as you complete research\n   - Mark planning tasks complete when done\n\n6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:\n   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP\n   - Research or ask for clarification immediately\n   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions\n   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable\n   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan\n\n## Success Criteria Guidelines\n\n**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**\n\n1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):\n   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.\n   - Specific files that should exist\n   - Code compilation/type checking\n   - Automated test suites\n\n2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):\n   - UI/UX functionality\n   - Performance under real conditions\n   - Edge cases that are hard to automate\n   - User acceptance criteria\n\n**Format example:**\n```markdown\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`\n- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`\n- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI\n- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items\n- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly\n- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices\n```\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### For Database Changes:\n- Start with schema/migration\n- Add store methods\n- Update business logic\n- Expose via API\n- Update clients\n\n### For New Features:\n- Research existing patterns first\n- Start with data model\n- Build backend logic\n- Add API endpoints\n- Implement UI last\n\n### For Refactoring:\n- Document current behavior\n- Plan incremental changes\n- Maintain backwards compatibility\n- Include migration strategy\n\n## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices\n\nWhen spawning research sub-tasks:\n\n1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency\n2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area\n3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:\n   - Exactly what to search for\n   - Which directories to focus on\n   - What information to extract\n   - Expected output format\n4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:\n   - If the ticket mentions \"WUI\", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory\n   - If it mentions \"daemon\", specify `hld/` directory\n   - Never use generic terms like \"UI\" when you mean \"WUI\"\n   - Include the full path context in your prompts\n5. **Specify read-only tools** to use\n6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses\n7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing\n8. **Verify sub-task results**:\n   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks\n   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase\n   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect\n\nExample of spawning multiple tasks:\n```python\n# Spawn these tasks concurrently:\ntasks = [\n    Task(\"Research database schema\", db_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Find API patterns\", api_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Investigate UI components\", ui_research_prompt),\n    Task(\"Check test patterns\", test_research_prompt)\n]\n```\n\n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n```\nUser: /implementation_plan\nAssistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...\n\nUser: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md\nAssistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...\n\n[Reads file fully]\n\nBased on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...\n\n[Interactive process continues...]\n```\n\nARGUMENTS: I'm deprecating the CLI. so, I need a plan to change the text that it shows, so that it only says that the CLI has been deprecated and is no longer suppoted, and people should use app.build instead.

However, the messaging needs to be updated to be more definitive, and there are still references to usage instructions that need to be changed.\n\nHere's the implementation plan:\n\n## CLI Deprecation Implementation Plan\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\nThe CLI codebase has already been partially deprecated:\n- Main app (`apps/cli/src/app.tsx`) returns only a `DeprecationBanner` component\n- Full CLI functionality is commented out (lines 32-43)\n- However, the current message says \"will be DEPRECATED soon!\" instead of definitively stating it's deprecated\n- Help text and README still show usage instructions as if the CLI is functional\n\n### What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not removing the CLI package entirely (keeping it published for users who may try to run it)\n- Not changing the package.json name or version\n- Not modifying any of the commented-out functionality\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\nUpdate all user-facing text to clearly state the CLI is deprecated and no longer supported, directing users to app.build instead.\n\n## Phase 1: Update Deprecation Messaging\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Main App Component\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update deprecation banner text to be definitive rather than \"soon\"\n\n```tsx\nfunction WebLinkButton() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text dimColor>Please use </Text>\n      <Text underline color=\"blueBright\">\n        https://app.build\n      </Text>\n      <Text dimColor> instead.</Text>\n    </Box>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DeprecationBanner() {\n  return (\n    <Banner key=\"banner\" title=\"⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\" borderColor=\"red\">\n      <Box flexDirection=\"column\">\n        <Text color=\"red\" bold>\n          This CLI has been{' '}\n          <Text color=\"red\" bold inverse>\n            DEPRECATED\n          </Text>{' '}\n          and is no longer supported.\n        </Text>\n        <WebLinkButton />\n      </Box>\n    </Banner>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. CLI Help Text\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx`\n**Changes**: Replace help text with deprecation notice\n\n```tsx\nconst cli = meow(\n  `\n\t⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\t\n\tThis CLI has been deprecated and is no longer supported.\n\tPlease use https://app.build instead.\n\t\n\tFor all new projects and continued development, \n\tvisit https://app.build in your web browser.\n`,\n  {\n    importMeta: import.meta,\n    flags: {\n      // Remove all flags as they're no longer relevant\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\n#### 3. README Documentation\n**File**: `apps/cli/README.md`\n**Changes**: Update to reflect deprecation status\n\n```markdown\n# @app.build/cli\n\n## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\nThis CLI has been **deprecated** and is **no longer supported**.\n\nPlease use **https://app.build** instead for all new projects and continued development.\n\n## Migration\n\nVisit [https://app.build](https://app.build) in your web browser to access the full platform functionality that was previously available through this CLI.\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLI builds successfully: `bun run build:cli`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] No runtime errors when starting CLI: `bun start`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Running `npx @app.build/cli` shows only the deprecation message\n- [ ] Running `npx @app.build/cli --help` shows deprecation notice instead of usage instructions\n- [ ] No functional CLI interface is accessible (only deprecation banner)\n- [ ] All text clearly states the CLI \"has been deprecated\" rather than \"will be\"\n- [ ] All references direct users to https://app.build\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `npx @app.build/cli` and verify only deprecation banner appears\n2. Run `npx @app.build/cli --help` and verify deprecation notice in help text\n3. Try various CLI flags and verify they don't provide functionality\n4. Verify README clearly communicates deprecation status\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- The CLI will start faster since it only renders a simple banner\n- No performance concerns as functionality has been removed\n\n## References\n\n- CLI source directory: `apps/cli/src/`\n- Main app component: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx:102-117`\n- CLI entry point: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx:15-30`"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":599,"cache_read_input_tokens":51784,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":599,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSjKC9iCJc2T22EqRUPxN","type":"assistant","uuid":"6e7935b4-86df-40c8-a133-a2ec0a2580c7","timestamp":"2025-09-02T09:11:27.394Z"}

Main App Component\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update WebLinkButton and DeprecationBanner components\n\n```tsx\nfunction WebLinkButton() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text dimColor>Please use </Text>\n      <Text underline color=\"blueBright\">\n        https://app.build\n      </Text>\n      <Text dimColor> instead.</Text>\n    </Box>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DeprecationBanner() {\n  return (\n    <Banner key=\"banner\" title=\"⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\" borderColor=\"red\">\n      <Box flexDirection=\"column\">\n        <Text color=\"red\" bold>\n          This CLI has been{' '}\n          <Text color=\"red\" bold inverse>\n            DEPRECATED\n          </Text>{' '}\n          and is no longer supported.\n        </Text>\n        <WebLinkButton />\n      </Box>\n    </Banner>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLI builds successfully: `bun run build:cli`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] No runtime errors when starting CLI: `bun start`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Running CLI shows definitive \"has been deprecated\" message\n- [ ] Message clearly states \"no longer supported\"\n- [ ] WebLinkButton text is concise and direct\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Update Help Text and CLI Interface\n\n### Overview\nReplace functional help text with deprecation notice to prevent confusion about CLI capabilities.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. CLI Help Text\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx`\n**Changes**: Replace help text with deprecation notice\n\n```tsx\nconst cli = meow(\n  `\n\t⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\t\n\tThis CLI has been deprecated and is no longer supported.\n\tPlease use https://app.build instead.\n\t\n\tFor all new projects and continued development, \n\tvisit https://app.build in your web browser.\n`,\n  {\n    importMeta: import.meta,\n    flags: {\n      // Remove all flags as they're no longer relevant\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLI builds successfully after help text changes: `bun run build:cli`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] No syntax errors in meow configuration\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Running `npx @app.build/cli --help` shows deprecation notice\n- [ ] No usage instructions or flag documentation appears\n- [ ] Clear direction to use app.build instead\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\nUpdate README to reflect deprecation status and provide migration guidance.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. README Documentation\n**File**: `apps/cli/README.md`\n**Changes**: Replace usage instructions with deprecation notice\n\n```markdown\n# @app.build/cli\n\n## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\nThis CLI has been **deprecated** and is **no longer supported**.\n\nPlease use **https://app.build** instead for all new projects and continued development.\n\n## Migration\n\nVisit [https://app.build](https://app.build) in your web browser to access the full platform functionality that was previously available through this CLI.\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] README markdown renders correctly\n- [ ] Links are properly formatted\n- [ ] No broken references to CLI functionality\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] README clearly communicates deprecation status\n- [ ] Migration path is obvious and actionable  \n- [ ] No confusion about CLI being functional\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- No unit tests required as changes are purely textual\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- Verify CLI starts and shows deprecation message\n- Verify help text shows deprecation notice\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `npx @app.build/cli` and verify only deprecation banner appears\n2. Run `npx @app.build/cli --help` and verify deprecation notice in help text\n3. Try various CLI flags and verify they don't provide functionality\n4. Verify README clearly communicates deprecation status\n5. Test that all messaging consistently uses \"has been deprecated\" language\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- The CLI will start faster since it only renders a simple banner\n- Reduced memory usage as no functional components are loaded\n- No performance concerns as functionality has been removed\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n- Users attempting to use the CLI will immediately see deprecation notice\n- No data migration required as CLI doesn't store persistent data\n- Existing CLI installations will show new messaging on next run\n\n## References\n\n- Original context: CLI deprecation request\n- CLI source directory: `apps/cli/src/`\n- Main app component: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx:102-117`\n- CLI entry point: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx:15-30`\n- Package configuration: `apps/cli/package.json`"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":201,"cache_read_input_tokens":52729,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":201,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1784,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSjKZWSThcJFxcjBV9Vna","type":"assistant","uuid":"73536aef-5606-49ca-ba3f-83ec51969346","timestamp":"2025-09-02T09:16:13.388Z"}

Main App Component\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update WebLinkButton and DeprecationBanner components\n\n```tsx\nfunction WebLinkButton() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text dimColor>Please use </Text>\n      <Text underline color=\"blueBright\">\n        https://app.build\n      </Text>\n      <Text dimColor> instead.</Text>\n    </Box>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DeprecationBanner() {\n  return (\n    <Banner key=\"banner\" title=\"⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\" borderColor=\"red\">\n      <Box flexDirection=\"column\">\n        <Text color=\"red\" bold>\n          This CLI has been{' '}\n          <Text color=\"red\" bold inverse>\n            DEPRECATED\n          </Text>{' '}\n          and is no longer supported.\n        </Text>\n        <WebLinkButton />\n      </Box>\n    </Banner>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLI builds successfully: `bun run build:cli`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] No runtime errors when starting CLI: `bun start`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Running CLI shows definitive \"has been deprecated\" message\n- [ ] Message clearly states \"no longer supported\"\n- [ ] WebLinkButton text is concise and direct\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Update Help Text and CLI Interface\n\n### Overview\nReplace functional help text with deprecation notice to prevent confusion about CLI capabilities.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. CLI Help Text\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx`\n**Changes**: Replace help text with deprecation notice\n\n```tsx\nconst cli = meow(\n  `\n\t⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\t\n\tThis CLI has been deprecated and is no longer supported.\n\tPlease use https://app.build instead.\n\t\n\tFor all new projects and continued development, \n\tvisit https://app.build in your web browser.\n`,\n  {\n    importMeta: import.meta,\n    flags: {\n      // Remove all flags as they're no longer relevant\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLI builds successfully after help text changes: `bun run build:cli`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] No syntax errors in meow configuration\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Running `npx @app.build/cli --help` shows deprecation notice\n- [ ] No usage instructions or flag documentation appears\n- [ ] Clear direction to use app.build instead\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\nUpdate README to reflect deprecation status and provide migration guidance.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. README Documentation\n**File**: `apps/cli/README.md`\n**Changes**: Replace usage instructions with deprecation notice\n\n```markdown\n# @app.build/cli\n\n## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\nThis CLI has been **deprecated** and is **no longer supported**.\n\nPlease use **https://app.build** instead for all new projects and continued development.\n\n## Migration\n\nVisit [https://app.build](https://app.build) in your web browser to access the full platform functionality that was previously available through this CLI.\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] README markdown renders correctly\n- [ ] Links are properly formatted\n- [ ] No broken references to CLI functionality\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] README clearly communicates deprecation status\n- [ ] Migration path is obvious and actionable  \n- [ ] No confusion about CLI being functional\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- No unit tests required as changes are purely textual\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- Verify CLI starts and shows deprecation message\n- Verify help text shows deprecation notice\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `npx @app.build/cli` and verify only deprecation banner appears\n2. Run `npx @app.build/cli --help` and verify deprecation notice in help text\n3. Try various CLI flags and verify they don't provide functionality\n4. Verify README clearly communicates deprecation status\n5. Test that all messaging consistently uses \"has been deprecated\" language\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- The CLI will start faster since it only renders a simple banner\n- Reduced memory usage as no functional components are loaded\n- No performance concerns as functionality has been removed\n\n## Migration Notes\n\n- Users attempting to use the CLI will immediately see deprecation notice\n- No data migration required as CLI doesn't store persistent data\n- Existing CLI installations will show new messaging on next run\n\n## References\n\n- Original context: CLI deprecation request\n- CLI source directory: `apps/cli/src/`\n- Main app component: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx:102-117`\n- CLI entry point: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx:15-30`\n- Package configuration: `apps/cli/package.json`"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":107,"cache_read_input_tokens":55402,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":107,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1783,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSjKcDWpLGuNrrXjjEtSq","type":"assistant","uuid":"ea00284c-b2d4-44e4-a1ed-478fc1e76e53","timestamp":"2025-09-02T09:16:39.476Z"}

These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Always read CLAUDE.md** in the repository root for codebase guidelines and standards\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Codebase Guidelines\n\nBefore implementing any code changes:\n- **Always reference CLAUDE.md** files in the repository for project-specific standards\n- Follow the established file naming conventions, architecture patterns, and tech stack guidelines\n- Adhere to the coding standards and development workflows outlined in the codebase documentation\n- Use the recommended libraries, components, and patterns specified in CLAUDE.md\n- Ensure all code changes align with the project's established conventions\n- Keep code comments to the minimum\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- **Adhere to codebase standards** from CLAUDE.md throughout implementation\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n\nDon't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n\nARGUMENTS: @thoughts/shared/plans/cli-deprecation-messaging.md"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"0980a66a-0717-42e3-8d39-c3f080dcea6d","timestamp":"2025-09-02T09:18:32.537Z"}

Now I can see the current state of all the files that need to be updated. Let me create a todo list to track my progress through the implementation phases, then start implementing.\n\nCurrent state analysis:\n1. `app.tsx` - The DeprecationBanner function on line 102-117 says \"This CLI will be DEPRECATED soon!\" - needs to change to \"has been DEPRECATED and is no longer supported\"\n2. `cli.tsx` - Still has full usage instructions and flags for a functional CLI (lines 15-58) - needs to be replaced with deprecation notice\n3. `README.md` - Very minimal, just shows usage instructions - needs to be replaced with deprecation notice\n\nAll of this matches what the plan described. Let me create todos and start implementation.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2866,"cache_read_input_tokens":65994,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2866,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CSjKnprrK6txYtBAqZsyy","type":"assistant","uuid":"cd005808-c171-42c4-9c5d-89065a6d28e4","timestamp":"2025-09-02T09:18:54.387Z"}

Overview\n\nUpdate the @app.build/cli to clearly communicate that it has been deprecated and is no longer supported, directing all users to use https://app.build instead.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\nThe CLI codebase has already been partially deprecated:\n- Main app (`apps/cli/src/app.tsx`) returns only a `DeprecationBanner` component\n- Full CLI functionality is commented out (lines 32-43)\n- However, the current message says \"will be DEPRECATED soon!\" instead of definitively stating it's deprecated\n- Help text and README still show usage instructions as if the CLI is functional\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- CLI already shows deprecation banner but messaging is ambiguous: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx:111`\n- Help text still provides usage instructions: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx:15-30`\n- README suggests CLI is functional: `apps/cli/README.md`\n\n## Desired End State\n\nA CLI that clearly communicates deprecation status with no ambiguity:\n- Definitive \"has been deprecated\" messaging instead of \"will be deprecated soon\"\n- Help text shows deprecation notice instead of usage instructions\n- README documents deprecation status and migration path\n- All references direct users to https://app.build\n\n### Verification:\n- Running `npx @app.build/cli` shows only clear deprecation message\n- Running `npx @app.build/cli --help` shows deprecation notice\n- No functional interface is accessible\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Not removing the CLI package entirely (keeping it published for users who may try to run it)\n- Not changing the package.json name or version  \n- Not modifying any of the commented-out functionality\n- Not removing build scripts or development tooling\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUpdate all user-facing text to use definitive language about deprecation status and provide clear migration guidance to app.build.\n\n## Phase 1: Update Core Deprecation Messages\n\n### Overview\nUpdate the main deprecation banner and associated messaging to be definitive rather than future-tense.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. Main App Component\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/app.tsx`\n**Changes**: Update WebLinkButton and DeprecationBanner components\n\n```tsx\nfunction WebLinkButton() {\n  return (\n    <Box>\n      <Text dimColor>Please use </Text>\n      <Text underline color=\"blueBright\">\n        https://app.build\n      </Text>\n      <Text dimColor> instead.</Text>\n    </Box>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DeprecationBanner() {\n  return (\n    <Banner key=\"banner\" title=\"⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\" borderColor=\"red\">\n      <Box flexDirection=\"column\">\n        <Text color=\"red\" bold>\n          This CLI has been{' '}\n          <Text color=\"red\" bold inverse>\n            DEPRECATED\n          </Text>{' '}\n          and is no longer supported.\n        </Text>\n        <WebLinkButton />\n      </Box>\n    </Banner>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLI builds successfully: `bun run build:cli`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] Linting passes: `bun lint`\n- [ ] No runtime errors when starting CLI: `bun start`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Running CLI shows definitive \"has been deprecated\" message\n- [ ] Message clearly states \"no longer supported\"\n- [ ] WebLinkButton text is concise and direct\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Update Help Text and CLI Interface\n\n### Overview\nReplace functional help text with deprecation notice to prevent confusion about CLI capabilities.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. CLI Help Text\n**File**: `apps/cli/src/cli.tsx`\n**Changes**: Replace help text with deprecation notice\n\n```tsx\nconst cli = meow(\n  `\n\t⚠️  DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\t\n\tThis CLI has been deprecated and is no longer supported.\n\tPlease use https://app.build instead.\n\t\n\tFor all new projects and continued development, \n\tvisit https://app.build in your web browser.\n`,\n  {\n    importMeta: import.meta,\n    flags: {\n      // Remove all flags as they're no longer relevant\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CLI builds successfully after help text changes: `bun run build:cli`\n- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes: `bun types:check`\n- [ ] No syntax errors in meow configuration\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Running `npx @app.build/cli --help` shows deprecation notice\n- [ ] No usage instructions or flag documentation appears\n- [ ] Clear direction to use app.build instead\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Update Documentation\n\n### Overview\nUpdate README to reflect deprecation status and provide migration guidance.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. README Documentation\n**File**: `apps/cli/README.md`\n**Changes**: Replace usage instructions with deprecation notice\n\n```markdown\n# @app.build/cli\n\n## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE\n\nThis CLI has been **deprecated** and is **no longer supported**.\n\nPlease use **https://app.build** instead for all new projects and continued development.\n\n## Migration\n\nVisit [https://app.build](https://app.build) in your web browser to access the full platform functionality that was previously available through this CLI.\n```\n\n### Success Criteria:\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] README markdown renders correctly\n- [ ] Links are properly formatted\n- [ ] No broken references to CLI functionality\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] README clearly communicates deprecation status\n- [ ] Migration path is obvious and actionable  \n- [ ] No confusion about CLI being functional\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests:\n- No unit tests required as changes are purely textual\n\n### Integration Tests:\n- Verify CLI starts and shows deprecation message\n- Verify help text shows deprecation notice\n\n### Manual Testing Steps:\n1. Run `npx @app.build/cli` and verify only deprecation banner appears\n2. Run `npx @app.build/cli --help` and verify deprecation notice in help text\n3.
