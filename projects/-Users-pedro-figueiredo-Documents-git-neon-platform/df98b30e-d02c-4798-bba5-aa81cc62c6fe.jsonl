These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen given a plan path:\n- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])\n- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan\n- **Always read CLAUDE.md** in the repository root for codebase guidelines and standards\n- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context\n- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together\n- Create a todo list to track your progress\n- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done\n\nIf no plan path provided, ask for one.\n\n## Codebase Guidelines\n\nBefore implementing any code changes:\n- **Always reference CLAUDE.md** files in the repository for project-specific standards\n- Follow the established file naming conventions, architecture patterns, and tech stack guidelines\n- Adhere to the coding standards and development workflows outlined in the codebase documentation\n- Use the recommended libraries, components, and patterns specified in CLAUDE.md\n- Ensure all code changes align with the project's established conventions\n- Keep code comments to the minimum\n\n## Implementation Philosophy\n\nPlans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:\n- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find\n- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next\n- **Adhere to codebase standards** from CLAUDE.md throughout implementation\n- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context\n- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections\n\nWhen things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.\n\nIf you encounter a mismatch:\n- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed\n- Present the issue clearly:\n  ```\n  Issue in Phase [N]:\n  Expected: [what the plan says]\n  Found: [actual situation]\n  Why this matters: [explanation]\n\n  How should I proceed?\n  ```\n\n## Verification Approach\n\nAfter implementing a phase:\n- Run the success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)\n- Fix any issues before proceeding\n- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos\n- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit\n\nDon't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.\n\n## If You Get Stuck\n\nWhen something isn't working as expected:\n- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code\n- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written\n- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance\n\nUse sub-tasks sparingly - mainly for targeted debugging or exploring unfamiliar territory.\n\n## Resuming Work\n\nIf the plan has existing checkmarks:\n- Trust that completed work is done\n- Pick up from the first unchecked item\n- Verify previous work only if something seems off\n\nRemember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.\n\nARGUMENTS: /Users/pedro.figueiredo/Documents/git/neon/platform/thoughts/shared/plans/ui-analyzer-agent.md"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"94c00019-73ec-490a-88af-74d0c9d650fb","timestamp":"2025-09-04T17:21:53.345Z"}

This agent complements the existing E2E testing infrastructure by providing live analysis capabilities.\n\n## What Was Created\n\n### UI Analyzer Agent (`.claude/agents/ui-analyzer.md`)\n\nA specialized agent that provides:\n\n- **Live UI Behavior Analysis**: Navigate and interact with web applications to understand real behavior\n- **Visual Interface Documentation**: Capture screenshots and accessibility snapshots  \n- **Interaction Flow Mapping**: Test complete user workflows and document patterns\n- **Technical Context Gathering**: Monitor network requests, console messages, and DOM behavior\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\n#### Browser Automation Tools Used:\n- Navigation: `browser_navigate`, `browser_wait_for`, `browser_tabs`\n- Interaction: `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_hover`, `browser_fill_form` \n- Analysis: `browser_snapshot`, `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_evaluate`\n- Monitoring: `browser_network_requests`, `browser_console_messages`\n- Responsive: `browser_resize` for multi-device testing\n\n#### Analysis Patterns:\n- **New Applications**: Systematic exploration and workflow documentation\n- **Feature Analysis**: Deep dive into specific functionality\n- **Bug Investigation**: Reproduce and diagnose issues with evidence\n- **UX/UI Review**: Comprehensive usability and design analysis\n\n## Integration with Existing Infrastructure\n\n### Complements Existing E2E Testing\n- **UI Analyzer**: Interactive analysis, exploration, and documentation\n- **Shared Context**: Uses same authentication patterns and environment setup\n\n### Application Coverage\n- **Web Application** (`apps/web`): Main user interface with chat and app building\n- **Admin Dashboard** (`apps/admin`): Management interface with CRUD operations\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Analyzing Chat Functionality\n```\nTask: Use ui-analyzer to understand how the chat system works in the web application\n\nThe agent would:\n1. Navigate to the web application\n2. Take screenshots of the chat interface\n3. Test message input and submission\n4. Document loading states and response patterns\n5. Analyze network requests to the backend API\n6. Capture different message types (user, agent, error states)\n```\n\n### Debugging Admin Interface Issues\n```\nTask: Use ui-analyzer to investigate reported issues with the admin user management table\n\nThe agent would:\n1. Navigate to the admin dashboard\n2. Reproduce the reported issue step-by-step\n3. Capture screenshots of expected vs actual behavior\n4. Monitor console for JavaScript errors\n5. Analyze network requests for API failures\n6. Document exact reproduction steps\n```\n\n### Documenting User Onboarding Flow\n```\nTask: Use ui-analyzer to document the complete user onboarding experience\n\nThe agent would:\n1. Start with unauthenticated state\n2. Test the GitHub OAuth flow\n3. Document first-time user experience\n4. Capture screenshots of each step\n5. Test error scenarios (failed auth, network issues)\n6. Create comprehensive flow documentation\n```\n\n## Benefits Over Traditional Approaches\n\n### vs Manual Testing\n- **Systematic**: Follows structured analysis patterns\n- **Documented**: Automatically captures visual evidence\n- **Reproducible**: Provides exact steps for reproduction\n- **Comprehensive**: Tests both happy path and edge cases\n\n### vs Static Code Analysis  \n- **Live Behavior**: Sees actual runtime behavior, not just code structure\n- **User Perspective**: Analyzes from end-user experience viewpoint\n- **Integration Testing**: Tests how components work together\n- **Real Performance**: Measures actual loading times and responsiveness\n\n### vs Traditional E2E Tests\n- **Exploratory**: Can discover issues through interactive exploration\n- **Documentation**: Creates human-readable analysis reports\n- **Contextual**: Provides business context alongside technical findings\n- **Flexible**: Can adapt analysis approach based on findings\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Authentication Handling\n- Leverages existing Stack Auth patterns from E2E testing\n- Can test both authenticated and unauthenticated states\n- Uses session storage for efficient auth state management\n\n### Environment Support\n- Works with local development environment (localhost:5173, localhost:3001)\n- Can be configured for staging/production environments\n- Integrates with existing development workflow\n\n### Technical Architecture\n- Built on Playwright MCP server tools for reliable browser automation\n- Follows established agent patterns for consistency\n- Provides structured output formats for documentation\n- Includes comprehensive error handling and debugging guidance\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Agent file created at `.claude/agents/ui-analyzer.md`\n- [ ] Agent follows established pattern with proper YAML frontmatter\n- [ ] All Playwright MCP tools properly referenced in tools list\n\n### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Agent can successfully navigate to web applications\n- [ ] Screenshots and snapshots are captured correctly\n- [ ] User workflow testing produces comprehensive documentation\n- [ ] Technical analysis captures network and console data\n- [ ] Output format provides actionable insights\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n### Potential Extensions:\n- **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare screenshots across code changes\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Add detailed performance metrics and analysis\n- **Accessibility Auditing**: Integrate comprehensive accessibility checking\n- **Integration with Issue Tracking**: Auto-create tickets for discovered issues\n\n### Advanced Capabilities:\n- **AI-Powered Issue Detection**: Use computer vision to detect UI inconsistencies\n- **Automated User Journey Mapping**: Generate complete user flow diagrams\n- **Component Library Analysis**: Analyze design system consistency\n- **Mobile-First Testing**: Enhanced mobile testing patterns\n\n## References\n\n- Original request: UI analyzer agent using Playwright MCP server tools\n- Existing agents: `.claude/agents/` (patterns and structure)\n- Playwright configuration: `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`\n- Application structure: `apps/web/`, `apps/admin/`","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":122,"oldLines":9,"newStart":122,"newLines":9,"lines":[" ## Success Criteria"," "," ### Automated Verification:","-- [ ] Agent file created at `.claude/agents/ui-analyzer.md`","-- [ ] Agent follows established pattern with proper YAML frontmatter","-- [ ] All Playwright MCP tools properly referenced in tools list","+- [x] Agent file created at `.claude/agents/ui-analyzer.md`","+- [x] Agent follows established pattern with proper YAML frontmatter","+- [x] All Playwright MCP tools properly referenced in tools list"," "," ### Manual Verification:"," - [ ] Agent can successfully navigate to web applications"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

You were absolutely right.
