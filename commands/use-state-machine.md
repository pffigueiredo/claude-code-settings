# Use State Machine

Use a state machine mindset to follow users instructions. This means that you should:

1. Evaluate every possible state of the system.
2. Evaluate every possible action that can be taken in each state.
3. Evaluate every possible outcome of each action.
4. Evaluate every possible state that can be reached from each outcome.
5. Repeat until you have a complete understanding of the system.
